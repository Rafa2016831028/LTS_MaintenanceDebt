We need to automate `Workspace stopping by idle timeout` test-case. To set secondsOfInactivityBeforeIdling property in CheClaster(patch) use KubernetesCommandLineToolsExecutor and ShellExecutor classes. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CRW-4836 ### How to test this PR? Test scenario: 1. Set spec.devEnvironments.secondsOfInactivityBeforeIdling:180 in CheCluster 2. Start workspace using VS Code Editor 3. Wait 3+ minutes (it should be 60 minutes by default). 4.

approving it. ::Why the sudden change in formatting of package.json?::nice, thank you for this implementation::Apply a prettier formatter + change some version of `vscode-extension-tester` lib for correct interaction with some UI elements. But you are right it looks a bit strange. I'll take a look at the formatted part again and change it if it is incorrect::thank you for explanation and verification::class should be injected::https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/main/tests/e2e/CODE_STYLE.md p.1.i::should be logout to run few test specs at once::better move to ShellExecutor class::constants should be declarated inside suit::https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/main/tests/e2e/CODE_STYLE.md p2.2::could it be inside projectAndFileTests.performTrustAuthorDialog() method?::can be just `.not.undefined`::is it getPodAndContainerNames() ?::Shell we add it into KubernetesCommandLineToolsExecutor? Like getContainerEnvs()::Can we use is it getPodAndContainerNames() here also? mb with some updates?::can`t check test suite locally because loginToOcp() method is missing.::No, it gets pod for by selector (`devworkspace_name=sample-using-parent`) for WorkpaseUsingParent.spec.ts test. For example, if in one namespace (admin-devspace), we have several running devspaces. This means we can have several pods. But this test needs a specific pod with parent functionality. And the command guarantee selection just it specific pod.::So it makes sense to extract it if we use it regularly. But WorkpaseUsingParent.spec.ts test is pretty specific. These specific commands are used in this test. But if we get precedent to use the same command in future tests, it will be better to extract in a method.::Usually, we do not use it in other tests. It is specific for this functionality. But if it repeats in other test parts - of course, it is better to extract it. My point is to avoid methods that will be used for one test.  In this case, we do not overload `KubernetesCommandLineToolsExecutor` class.::Well, I supposed if we run it on CI - it will be applied approach like in the PredefinedNamespaceTest: https://main-jenkins-csb-crwqe.apps.ocp-c1.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/Testing/job/e2e/job/basic/job/typescript-tests/12044/console, and mount kubeconfig directory: `-v /home/hudson/.kube:/home/seluser/.kube:Z ` this file stores sessions with logins. And we do not need to do it in the test twice.  If you want to check it locally, you can log in with oc client manually and run the test as well. ::it is additional manual steps to remember. method checks firstly if user already logged. https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/17b7a3e8e0e3138ddfadd95414a97e931e4667d0/tests/e2e/specs/miscellaneous/PredefinedNamespace.spec.ts#L38C14-L38C14 in the PredefinedNamespaceTest we have login method after refactoring ::Applied in the https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/22544::implemented: https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/22544::implemented: https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/22544::implemented: https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/22544::implemented: https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/22544::",093a8acd476a107f17031a361fc4a5de7d42a050::

An alternative is to move the functions into new class Workspace Locators, and then remove `Locator` suffix from function names.::doesn`t it returns us web element? >  Typings for lib/by.js Describes a mechanism for locating an element on the page. >  Locates elements matching a XPath selector. Care should be taken when using an XPath selector with a WebElement as WebDriver will respect the context in the specified in the selector. For example, given the selector //div, WebDriver will search from the document root regardless of whether the locator was used with a WebElement. > Params: > xpath – The XPath selector to use. > Returns: > !By The new locator. I can switch it back, no problem ::but isn`t it sounds right - wait visibility of locator? We had ""locator"" suffix when this functions were returns us strings. Sorry I am a little bit confused.::Workspace status is actually a string with value from the list [""Stopped"", ""Running"", ...]. So, I would expect Workspaces.getWorkspaceStatus() function to return the ready to use actual status of workspace instantly as it without any additional manipulations. `getWorkspaceStatusLocator()` function in turn is returning locator of status label at the Workspaces page as an object of class ""By"", which should be applied to another method to get actual status information at the page, e.g. to wait on visibility of `Running` status https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/main/tests/e2e/pageobjects/dashboard/Workspaces.ts#L71 : ``` await this.driverHelper.waitVisibility(this.getWorkspaceStatusLocator(workspaceName, WorkspaceStatusUI.Running), timeout); ``` So, `getWorkspaceStatusLocator()` != `getWorkspaceStatus()` from this perspective, IMHO.::Could you please add verification of Username to the test, following test scenario from https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/codeready-workspaces/test-cases/-/blob/master/tests/functional/miscellaneous/m19-check-links-to-documentation-page-in-dashboard.md ?::will do ::makes sense ::thank you taking notice into account::thanks::",7d24908b934b8fbb7dff4f8d71aa6fb1c2a17379::

This PR does not change test logic but adds some stabilization actions to doing the GitHub workflow more reliable.  From time to time we had `no left space on device` error.  It happened because the default disk size provided by GitHub is 14 GB. We have a big image like UDI which can be more than 9 GB. This is the main reason for the problems. Solution - reduce using space by removing unnecessary images and remove e2e test repo after running API test. ### Screenshot/screencast of this PR ![Selection_016](https://github.com/eclipse/che/assets/1640058/b0b77cda-e71e-405c-9a19-fb2e9684930e) ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/22418 ### How to test this PR?

Therefore, correct image is address: quay.io/che-incubator/che-code:next .::it is just a name which will be shown in Actions tab and has no effect on build actions: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#name I believe it should be clear what has built, why and where was pushed from this name.

So, it's reasonable to run PR check against Eclipse Che Next.::Let's comment it somewhere in the repo what exactly does PR check do?::okay::I see. My point was that the this eclipse/che repo is not dedicated to e2e tests (looking at the root folder files), so I was not sure if it's eligible to modify `build-next` action. Moreover - this action has outdated code which we don't need anymore: ``` - name: Cache local Maven repository uses: actions/cache@v3 with: path: ~/.m2/repository key: ${{ runner.os }}-maven-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }} restore-keys: | ${{ runner.os }}-maven- - name: Set up JDK 11 uses: actions/setup-java@v3 with: distribution: 'adopt' java-version: '11' ``` Anyway, we can consider movement to dedicated repo https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-tests BTW: there is a TYPO in name: `quai.io` > `quay.io`.::Fixed::Added::",9a47941cfec46738a7c2faa4e23fcc01ac97f2da::

Is it possible to set command build timeout, e.g. adding prefix to command `timeout $commandTimeoutSec <command>`?::But we have almost the same name of the test above. It is the same in factories and quarkus ui. Maybe ""Check if project files were imported""?::Okay, I will change it for ""commands""::Yes, but than this test will be marked as successful without any logs inside. ::For example build of quarkus sample from github registry takes more than 20 minutes.. I tried this approach you propose but than decided that mocha test timeout will be enough  ::""Check if project files are imported"" then, using Present Simple.::Well, script could log `Devfile does not contains build commands.` in test ""Collect build commands from the devfile"", and skip test`Check if build command returns success` and so make scenario one test simpler, couldn't it?::If you are talking about `if(devfileBuildCommands === 0) this.test.skip()` it is impossible, because mocha framework initializes completely before any test code runs, but collection of commands inside another test. So we will receave skip for this test for any sample.::I think there could be non trivial workaround, but not sure it necessary ::okay we can leave it as it::thanks::I see. How can mocha test timeout be set when call the test?::Could you try to simplify the code and use pre-defined environment variables in container if execute  bash command `-- bash -c ""${commandToExecute}""`, following suggestion from @l0rd ?::We have it in the mocharc.js But I also added this.timeout(25m) for the suite. Is it okay?::25 minutes is way too much. Workspace idle timeout is 10 minutes, as far as I remember. At the same time project could build quite a long time in disconnected environment when use proxied artifactory. Let's keep it as it for build commands. Specific timeout setting will be needed when test non-terminating commands like run and debug.::Updated with method updateCommandEnvsToShStyle(), all tests passed::thanks::",82b219de7404e861fe159371efa23690eacee796::d1fc238b1b1d4e78a4a6546fa547a5aabdba4404::

If you want to use it as a timeout, I'd rather consider calculating it locally in the `waitDisappearanceTwoFactorInfoBox` method as follows: ``` const attempts: number = TimeoutConstants.TS_SELENIUM_GIT_TWO_FACTOR_TIMEOUT / polling; ``` and then use the `attempts` local variable::Thanks for the review, I've taken the polling rate into account and I've rewritten it.::ACK, thank you.::Is this timeout should be so long?::I can decrease it, but I don't see any impact on the tests since the pipelines autofail after 6 mins anyway. Till the 2FA isn't automated we are waiting on human input anyway.::On our last QE sync call we had an agreement to have all locators as `private static readonly` and By type. It will be very nice if you will fix it in this pageobject class you currently working on ☺️::Could you please explain, for what reason have you add this new lines?::https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_BlAqY1s8Ou__9iMQR2ZtmUnkuJ1VHDVtSBTV5-_Uv0/edit#heading=h.yr66jvhjgpfu::why here added this new line?::![image](https://github.com/eclipse/che/assets/72726250/9e867c4d-94e6-4e78-a6b7-29a3824fdc4a) I am not sure all this new lines necessary. Can you switch them back?::You added this timeout into plugin section. Can you move it up, or add some comment?::I didn't manually touch the file before and after linting it so this was done by the linter itself.::can we move this logic into waitDisappearance() method and pass timeout as time (TimeoutConstants.TS_SELENIUM_GIT_TWO_FACTOR_TIMEOUT)? Like here: https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/666379174db85eecdef7903e47202329ef50a8c7/tests/e2e/utils/DriverHelper.ts#L95::Why here new lines added?::As I can see, 2FA is applied to any scope, but as I remember we don't have it, for example here _https://bitbucket-bitbucket.apps.ds-airgap-v12.crw-qe.com_ or here _https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com_ for factory tests. Did you try to run some test without it? Maybe it is better to add some env variable, like: `TestConstants.TS_SELENIUM_IS_2FA_ENABLED === 'true'` ?::@Daybringer : timeouts in tests should be as minimal as possible to fail test quickly if there is nothing to wait, and so have test result as soon as possible, and decrease cost of test execution. Which maximum time of waiting for disappearance of Two Factor Authentication info box did you see when run the test?::I could but the check will fall through when there's no 2FA to wait for so I think another TestConstant isn't required.::@dmytro-ndp Mentioned in https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/22202/commits/c8885d3dd2977d26e6ae5839ec7eb29e5dc8fdda ::This sounds like a good idea, but this change would affect other parts of the project since it's a part of a driver.::",8ec9d90a204c1e99006a0cbc3168f83a6552ddc9::274d084a6e5ca3ac177ce09e64a12d442974905c::6935fe862bdbd535f10b456a8231760a4fb69d63::335592566bbf49e3a5a96ba3f9bee0bb4c50cc8d::c8885d3dd2977d26e6ae5839ec7eb29e5dc8fdda::51343a1515e6ef3c5235bba37ed0dc9e1b61a8f7::19312a0a8ce075ae470c796b9fdec0b6e448b186::

Maybe adding some context to the output would make it more usable. Or should it be removed altogether?::c.c. unfriendly logging::c.c. unfriendly logging::does this mean the test will be re-executed 10 times until success or eventual failure?::Seems like TRACE would be a more appropriate level for messages like these::It will return **OcpMainPage.openFromGit**. The purpose not to have hard-coded strings, if class or method name will be changed log message will be changed too. ::yes, test can fail because extension is still installing ::We have mostly all logs on debug level in **.spec.ts files. Trace inside utils.::I like this approach, because it allows to have the log message fixed automatically during refactoring using automated development tools.::@ScrewTSW : could you, please, explain what exactly looked unfriendly? Did you mean readability of code? I am curios, because output should be similar to what we have already had in another code, e.g. https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/main/tests/e2e/pageobjects/dashboard/Dashboard.ts#L66 ``` async stopAndRemoveWorkspaceByUI(workspaceName: string): Promise<void> { Logger.debug(`Dashboard.stopAndRemoveWorkspaceByUI ""${workspaceName}""`); ... ```::`ExtensionsViewSection` looks like regular locator. If there is nothing special, I would suggest to move it to locators, as more relevant place.::IMHO, it would improve code readability if get method info from utility method, like following: ``` function getCallerInfo(): string { const error = new Error(); // Use regular expressions to parse the stack trace const stackTrace = error.stack || ''; const classNameMatch = stackTrace.match(/at\s+(\S+)\./); const className = classNameMatch ? classNameMatch[1] : undefined; let methodNameMatch; if (className) { const methodNameRegex = new RegExp(`at ${className}\\.(\\S+)`); methodNameMatch = stackTrace.match(methodNameRegex); } const methodName = methodNameMatch ? methodNameMatch[1] : undefined; return `${className}.${methodName}` } ```::At the same time you could consider simpler way to get method info: https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/22201/files#r1189665731::What was the reason to divide stop and delete, if it could be done at ones? The less code in tear down steps like this, the simpler to read it and support, IMHO.::I would suggest to leave 2-3 retries, to avoid too long test execution log.::Agree, but it is better to improve our Logger class, this is out of scope here::https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/22204 ::It improves test stability. It is about the situation when uses stopAndRemoveWorkspace() method. When stopping of working workspace will be successful but deleting will be not (for example, because of unexpected page refresh, [jira issue](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CRW-3649)) retry will starts with stopping of workspace  again what will return an error, and than all CI stage will be failed and red.   ::https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/3a7b3857ced5d8c407379046756196b1e0bc80ff/tests/e2e/pageobjects/ide/CheCodeLocatorLoader.ts#L19::We have 5 retries as default and ti is not enough.

Also name `isUserLoggedIn` doesn't comply with value. **Expected value**: true or false **Actual value**: string with output of `oc whoami --show-server=true` like `admin`, or error message if user hasn't logged into the cluster. I would suggest to extract the code into the `isUserLoggedIn()` method: ``` private isUserLoggedIn(): boolean { const whoamiCommandOutput: ShellString = this.execWithLog('oc whoami --show-server=true'); return whoamiCommandOutput.stdout.includes(TestConstants.TS_SELENIUM_OCP_USERNAME) && whoamiCommandOutput.stdout.includes(url) } ``` ::It's interesting to know the case when it's needed to retry creation of already existed project.::What do you think about replacement of lines 99-110 including whole `for-loop` with one command: ``` exec(`${this.KUBERNETES_COMMAND_LINE_TOOL} new-project ${projectName} -n ${this.namespace} || true`) ``` ?::So that `applicationSourceProjectName` is already a **string**, then casting it to **unknown** and then back to **string** with `as unknown as string` is unnecessary and redundant.

Should I move this method somewhere?::TestConstants.ts holds test constants which can be redefined using environment variables. `TS_SELENIUM_OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL():` is not constant, and doesn't look like method with capitalized characters. Taking into account that it's needed for `LoginTests.loginIntoOcpConsole()`, and that the application name is `console-openshift-console` in 99,9% cases, I would suggest to move the logic to there.::Makes sense ::This locator uses just once, so I decide inline it.

The easiest way was not to add these changes in the origin repo. I created a fork and used it.  I cannot remember the place with a fix. But anyway you can replace this test project in any place and use it at your discretion::@musienko-maxim So should it be exactly this java project or we can use, for example, our NodeJs sample? Which will be labels, in that case :)::Or we can just move it to our qe-crw GitHub repo::Done::Done ::There is better example to follow, with agreed style of locators declaration in Che E2E TypeScript tests: https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/main/tests/e2e/pageobjects/dashboard/Dashboard.ts#L22-L37::I see. In this case there is no need to create project again,if I understood it correctly. Therefore next single command should work as well, because will not fail in case if project has been already existed (with ending `|| true`): ``` exec(`${this.KUBERNETES_COMMAND_LINE_TOOL} new-project ${projectName} -n ${this.namespace} || true`) ```::Another point of view is that the code will need support in future, and it's hard to understand which particular UI element it is testing  looking at xpath in the code, especially taking into account that xpath or another locator could be modified in future product versions.::Thanks::thanks for the fix::looks better now, thanks::Thanks for the fix.::Than we should fix it in all project ::It's interesting to know what is the reason to call `oc whoami` command twice at a time?::looks better now, thanks::We need to recreate it, because import from git in DevConsole will be unsuccessful ::One shows username and second - server url::Okay, I will fix it in my new classes but we should refactor it in all project to have one style everywhere ::Got it. Thanks!::Btw, maybe it will be better to use already locators, not stings? ::Like `private static readonly MAIN_PAGE_HEADER_LOCATOR: By = By.id('page-main-header');`::Basically, recreation of project is not a trivial and risky operation, especially if there workspaces have been already created [1]. It would simpler to fail the test if there is project existed, IMHO @musienko-maxim : what do you think?

This PR adds `api load tests` scripts that will be used in DevSpaces performance testing. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? Openshift DevSpaces issue - [Estimate time of java project build and run inside Che Code Editor in performance tests](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CRW-4044). ### How to test this PR? 1. Create test users on cluster using [performance-users](https://main-jenkins-csb-crwqe.apps.ocp-c1.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/Testing/job/Performance/job/performance-users-creation/) job. 2. Api load test starts by command like: ``` ./api-load-tests.sh -u user  -p load-user -s lombok -n 11 -c 1 -b https://devspaces.crw-qe.com -o https://api.ocp410.com:6443 -u base username -p common password -b URL of DevSpaces -o Openshift cluster URL -s test suite (by default its php) -n number of users ${NC} usernames will be set in format <username>1, <username>2(by default its 1) -c count on how many times one user should run a workspace(by default its 1) ``` For now `php`, `cpp`, `python`, `lombok` and `quarkus` suites are available for testing. 3. Tests results adds to result.txt with format like: ``` Load testing for 11 users x 1 workspaces took 215 seconds 11 tests passed 0 tests failed Workspace startup time: min: 37 second avr: 44 second max: 50 second Project build time: min: 140 second avr: 142 second max: 146 second ``` All logs from test pods saved in reports folder. ### PR Checklist [As the author of this Pull Request I made sure that:](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-template-and-its-checklist) - [ ] [The Eclipse Contributor Agreement is valid](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-eclipse-contributor-agreement-is-valid) - [ ] [Code produced is complete](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-produced-is-complete) - [ ] [Code builds without errors](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-builds-without-errors) - [ ] [Tests are covering the bugfix or new feature ](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#tests-are-covering-the-bugfix-or-new-feature) - [ ] [The repository devfile is up to date and works](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-repository-devfile-is-up-to-date-and-works) - [ ] [Sections `What issues does this PR fix or reference` and `How to test this PR` completed](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sections-what-issues-does-this-pr-fix-or-reference-and-how-to-test-this-pr-completed) - [ ] [Relevant user documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [ ] [Relevant contributing documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [ ] [CI/CD changes implemented, documented and communicated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#cicd-changes-implemented-documented-and-communicated) ### Reviewers Reviewers, please comment how you tested the PR when approving it. ::There is no ""TEST_SUITE"" parameter in eclipse/che e2e tests anymore.

We are using `waitWorkspaceReadiness` function in our tests for checking workspace starting, checking notifications and project importing. This PR adds devworkspace specific `waitWorkspaceReadinessDevworkspace` function. Also this function collapses `Open Editor` window(see screenshot). Some test projects has many files and we need to collapse `Open Editor` to make them visible. Changes were added and checked on `TypescriptPlugin` and `VscodeYamlPlugin` tests. ### Screenshots ![screenshot-Open_file (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7760565/155158287-673dfaa7-b20d-43d1-be32-efd562b7e9bf.png) ### How to test this PR? <!-- Please explain for example : - The test platform (openshift, kubernetes, minikube, CodeReady Container, docker-desktop, etc) - Installation method: chectl / che-operator - steps to reproduce --> ### PR Checklist [As the author of this Pull Request I made sure that:](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-template-and-its-checklist) - [ ] [The Eclipse Contributor Agreement is valid](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-eclipse-contributor-agreement-is-valid) - [ ] [Code produced is complete](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-produced-is-complete) - [ ] [Code builds without errors](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-builds-without-errors) - [ ] [Tests are covering the bugfix or new feature ](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#tests-are-covering-the-bugfix-or-new-feature) - [ ] [The repository devfile is up to date and works](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-repository-devfile-is-up-to-date-and-works) - [ ] [Sections `What issues does this PR fix or reference` and `How to test this PR` completed](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sections-what-issues-does-this-pr-fix-or-reference-and-how-to-test-this-pr-completed) - [ ] [Relevant user documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [ ] [Relevant contributing documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [ ] [CI/CD changes implemented, documented and communicated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#cicd-changes-implemented-documented-and-communicated) ### Reviewers Reviewers, please comment how you tested the PR when approving it. ::",401faa27aa2df19c13ce1ccf0e26f82d953416c7::f728b0e4d28e6c83b3df9531b73ed38db6d16e24::f85a00fa3048415810d021d1db39ff870ee3ba75::

We are using `setPreferenceUsingUI` function in our tests to set preferences by UI(open settings.json file and change content). It works well when settings.json file has any content. But without content it tries to parse empty string. Also set **TS_DELETE_PLUGINS_TEST_WORKSPACE** property to true to delete workspace after test is finished.

The ""natural"" update of package-lock.json will happen by merging devs PRs (Devs will naturally do ""npm install"" locally, which should update package-lock.json and this one should be commited&pushed together with their PR). As for `npm audit` - From what I read `npm audit fix` will update just within the ranges defined in package.json. To properly udpate deps to resolve the vulnerabilities we would need to run `npm audit fix --force` which updates package.json as well.::```suggestion The easiest way is to run them via Docker. To build locally you have to execute the following command: ```::@mkuznyetsov - Please execute `npm audit fix --force` and update the package.json, package.lock.json. So we are good to merge the pr. cc: @dmytro-ndp ::@mkuznets - On `npm audit fix --force` the mocha version is updating from `7.1.1` to `9.1.3`,  Where opts files are [deprecated](https://main-jenkins-csb-crwqe.apps.ocp4.prod.psi.redhat.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/Che%2Fe2e%2Fminikube%2Fpr-check%2Fche-tests-pr-check/detail/che-tests-pr-check/287/pipeline/).

Wit the hardcoded value the code is less configurable and you need to send a PR to change this value, instead of setting the env var to change that. [0] https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/main/tests/e2e/TimeoutConstants.ts#L158::The problem with a variable that if you increase the ""TS_SELENIUM_CLICK_ON_VISIBLE_ITEM"" variable, you also increase the delay for each time you will invoke this function. I faced that when I increased the ""TS_SELENIUM_CLICK_ON_VISIBLE_ITEM"" to 60 seconds. The 5 seconds is more than enough for drop-down expanding so I don't see any reason to have there a dynamic value.::I have 5 entries in the test with such method, so it means that if I configure ""TS_SELENIUM_CLICK_ON_VISIBLE_ITEM=60000"" I need to wait 5 minutes (1 minute for each entry) instead 5 seconds in each entry, for drop-down animation quite enough 1-second delay, the 5 seconds is a huge stock.::I was thinking about that, working with a drop-down menu is a general case. What do you think if I create a class (for example) DropDownAnimationChecker with the function ""waitAnimationEnd"". Right now I will add a simple sleep to this method, but when we have time we can rework that for checking and compare container square size (I have already done a similar method for other repo). ::Thank you for your explanation. Using ""stupid"" `sleep` and `wait` without waiting on some event isn't a best practice at all, so I agree with creating some handler as you suggested - e.g. for checking the container size. So, if you can create an issue for this implementation, I'm OK with leaving this hardcoded 5sec wait there for now.::@Katka92 Take a look at my last PR https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/19963/commits/00495856d283ac40bf04bb4e2e75a6e94c8ddacd::@Katka92 here is an issue https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/19965::",19eebf41c7038c52bf33d10e055b6d9cf8dcb87c::00495856d283ac40bf04bb4e2e75a6e94c8ddacd::

I would instead try something from below solutions: 1. Set the environment variable `TS_SELENIUM_PREVIEW_WIDGET_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`  (which is used directly in the `waitAndSwitchTOWidgetFrame` [method](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/384f90b6f07d7c3475ca9239f4f2b365e68b536c/tests/e2e/pageobjects/ide/PreviewWidget.ts#L73)) to something larger than default (10_000 ms) so it will be increased for your particular test. 2. Increase the default value of `TS_SELENIUM_PREVIEW_WIDGET_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT` [here](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/384f90b6f07d7c3475ca9239f4f2b365e68b536c/tests/e2e/TimeoutConstants.ts#L173), so it will be larger in every test using that method. 3. Leave the default timeout as is and add an optional timeout parameter to the `waitAndSwitchToWidgetFrame` method so the timeout can be adjusted per method call. If you need any help solving that issue, feel free to ping me.::If you trying to fix a problem with a blank screen, unfortunately, a simple wait will not help. You need to gain an application route, and if a blank screen has shown, type this route to the widget address bar. Another way is to open the application in the browser tab instead preview widget. ::Example for using browser tab https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/main/tests/e2e/tests/plugins/TypescriptPlugin.spec.ts#L98-L155::Interesting, just for curiosity - is it known what is the root cause of this `blank screen` problem? Is there some issue created? Thanks::As far as I remember it was some issue about that. But I am not sure. The main problem, this problem doesn't reproduce by hands. It is something specific for automation.::@Katka92, @Ohrimenko1988: thank you for review! @Katka92: The problem is that after switching to Preview Widget frame the test can't find ""**Welcome**"" message and [then instantly clicking on ""refresh"" button in Preview Widget, which redirects to ""blank:empty"" page](https://main-jenkins-csb-crwqe.apps.ocp4.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/Che/job/e2e/job/minikube/job/pr-check/job/che-theia-pr-check/137/consoleFull). There is an issue about broken refresh button exists https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/19910 @Ohrimenko1988: actually, it has been working with simple 10 seconds wait. E.g., you can compare: - failed Happy path tests https://main-jenkins-csb-crwqe.apps.ocp4.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/Che/job/e2e/job/minikube/job/pr-check/job/che-theia-pr-check/137/consoleFull - passed Happy path tests with timeout in the same PR: https://main-jenkins-csb-crwqe.apps.ocp4.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/Che/job/e2e/job/minikube/job/pr-check/job/che-theia-pr-check/143/consoleFull IMHO, another possible ""timeout less"" solution in this case could be not clicking on ""**Refresh**"" button at all (`this.refreshPage()`), but waiting on page to be fully loaded in Preview Widget.::I've searched a little in our codebase and there is already method including this polling/attmepts mechanism: https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/3df3228210d625b490cf16ff2a926369d6f4ec14/tests/e2e/utils/DriverHelper.ts#L63 So maybe whole this [block](https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/19909/files#diff-e3e126311533b5946de6dbfa699df2efaa80613f43750e687fa6a377f1aee855L90-L102) can be just replaced by the method I shared.

I would recommend using one of our test library methods, e.g. https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/tests/e2e/testsLibrary/ProjectAndFileTests.ts#L30::Using the direct `wait` is not a good practice. Is there a reason for it as the next step is the stop of the workspace?::It will not work here because this workspace doesn't have sample project.::Yes.. this test is based on 'GitSsh' E2E test and I was checking it, without this step the test will fail.::I can comment this too.. This test is mostly based on tge 'GitSsh' E2E, and this wait is a compelled step. Because the method which checks 'data synchronized' on UI waits disappearance specific event / locator, works properly, but these changes are not immediately appeared on GitHub side repo (may say not alwyas). So for reliable,  it was used this timeout.::Intresting, I don't understand why, but I believe you. Thanks for info::I see. We should think about adding a method that will wait for workspace readiness even for the workspace without a project - we are obviously missing one.

https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse/che,19752,fix_url_match::master,0,merged,kind/bug::,"### What does this PR do? It is reported that sometimes user secrets containing SCM tokens are ignored. Investigation showed that SCM URL-s in factory and in secrets compared directly, wichi is not good, since them may differ by trailing slash. This PR fixes the situation and now URls are compared without the influence of the trailing slash PS. During testing, PAT validation bug  for GitLab found. So it is fixes this bug as well. ### Screenshot/screencast of this PR <!-- Please include a screenshot or a screencast explaining what is doing this PR --> ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? ### How to test this PR? 1) Create new/edit existing secret with the personal access token, containing `scm-url` annotation with trailing slash, as follows: ``` che.eclipse.org/scm-url: 'https://gitlab.apps.cluster-max-fbfa.max-fbfa.example.opentlc.com/' ``` 2) Run the private GitLab project factory from that server. Error in accessing devfile will be shown. 3) Deploy che server image `quay.io/skabashn/che-server:che19752` 4) After the fix, the factory should run without an error. ### PR Checklist [As the author of this Pull Request I made sure that:](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-template-and-its-checklist) - [x] [The Eclipse Contributor Agreement is valid](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-eclipse-contributor-agreement-is-valid) - [x] [Code produced is complete](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-produced-is-complete) - [x] [Code builds without errors](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-builds-without-errors) - [x] [Tests are covering the bugfix](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#tests-are-covering-the-bugfix) - [ ] [The repository devfile is up to date and works](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-repository-devfile-is-up-to-date-and-works) - [x] [Sections `What issues does this PR fix or reference` and `How to test this PR` completed](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sections-what-issues-does-this-pr-fix-or-reference-and-how-to-test-this-pr-completed) - [ ] [Relevant user documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [ ] [Relevant contributing documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [ ] [CI/CD changes implemented, documented and communicated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#cicd-changes-implemented-documented-and-communicated) ### Reviewers Reviewers, please comment how you tested the PR when approving it. ::",ec443649f891c919c8aebee8b9cf6b0cea6790f1::7169166813937e2147c51330796a91e694215b70::193f109efce29394e36bd0c654bc4903f19db5ba::a9b39db7d59bd3ac80e7236f4b864e15624517de::5ee52f170ff26f987c0da5f8c8e536afcc760c25::aea541e0106d8daa2b38b4fcbe1c64f0143ee695::3201f943873d86dafd4d1bb30bc7ba0f431ef50b::8f58230f0471bbfd16b94f312ef37c2205b3841c::

Does it make sense here?::I haven't tested myself, but you're not starting wiremock server here. I guess it's working for you only because you're starting it in `shouldResolveCallbackWithUserId()` test. You should start/close before/after each test method, or before/after whole the test class. Check `@BeforeMethod` `@AfterMethod` or `@BeforeTest` `@AfterTest` or `@BeforeClass` `@AfterClass`. ::You're using same port as in `HttpBitbucketServerApiClientTest`. This might cause issues when you try to run these tests in parallel.::I think it's not needed in all cases. I believe it needs only in good/correct flow and not needed in case of some errors. ::if some exception happen in code above, the server won't be stopped. I would either put it in `try finally`, or make `wireMockServer` class variable and add `@AfterMethod` with `if wireMockServer != null -> stop` (like here https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/multiuser/keycloak/che-multiuser-keycloak-server/src/test/java/org/eclipse/che/multiuser/keycloak/server/OIDCInfoProviderTest.java#L67)::Thanks for the explanation. Implemented it. It should be cleaner now.::Hope this is not copied from somewhere important :)::Not sure hard coding the port numbers is generally a good idea.

So maybe it would be enough just to increase a timeout if your workspace is larger and therefore start takes more time (setting one variable when tests are run).

This one and `DriverHelper.navigateToUrl`.::I, personally, don't see much value in most of these onliners. I guess the goal was to make the test more readable... but in my opinion I don't think this is that significant improvement to legitimize these methods. I mean... ``` browserTabsUtils.switchToWindow(""sting"") ``` vs ``` driverHelper.getDriver().switchTo().window(""string"") ``` is not a big difference (both are pretty clear to me). If I'm the only one who's feeling this way, I'm not blocking the PR on this ;-)::In my opinion, at least using this we have a clear steps in the logs: ``` ✓ Wait debug connected (16463ms) ▼ BrowserTabsUtil.switchToWindow ▼ BrowserTabsUtil.waitContentAvailableInTheNewTab ▼ BrowserTabsUtil.refreshPage ✓ Refresh application sample window (30339ms) ▼ BrowserTabsUtil.switchToWindow ▼ Ide.waitAndSwitchToIdeFrame ▼ Editor.waitStoppedDebugBreakpoint title: ""app.js"" line: ""19"" ▼ Editor.isBreakpointPresent ``` Imagine these logs without ""BrowserTabsUtil"". Besides if it possible not to use driver directly in the test, better doesn't use it (best practices). ::Could you please clarify your suggestion? Delete one of them?::Besides, your example not completely right. There is how it will look like in real code: ``` await browserTabsUtil.switchToWindow('string'); vs await (await driverHelper.getDriver()).switchTo().window('string') ```::This class is mirroring some behavior from `DriverHelper` and is actually duplicating some of the methods there. As the `DriverHelper` class is quite long, I'm +1 for moving all Tabs related functions here - like for example those methods: - getCurrentUrl - waitURL - navigateAndWaitToUrl - navigateToUrl - reloadPage - maximize WDYT?::The idea is good but doesn't look so easy, I guess a lot of tests should be updated. We can create an issue for that.::As I skimmed the usage of those methods, I don't think it's something taking more than half a day/one day of work (changes + some basic testing) so I would prefer to have that done together in one PR. If you're not willing to do that now, then please create the issue.::I was thinking more in line of marking the DriverHelper methods as deprecated in this PR and removing them in few released in separate PR.::> As I skimmed the usage of those methods, I don't think it's something taking more than half a day/one day of work (changes + some basic testing) so I would prefer to have that done together in one PR. If you're not willing to do that now, then please create the issue. I strongly disagree with that. I don't have a day for spending it with such issue with low priority.

At this stage, nobody except me will work with these files. So I don't see any reason to complicate my work and add temporary devfiles to the official repository.::Actually the test is verifying ""**Suggestion invoking**"" not ""**Codenavigation**"".::According to the description of solving issue https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/19437 the test should check both ""Code navigation"" and ""Suggestion invoking"": ![Screenshot from 2021-03-30 12-55-24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1197777/112970789-40c88f00-9157-11eb-94ed-a0c0bb9c28a7.png) ::""Ctrl + F12"" is a ""Open definition"" function it opens class definition. Is that not code navigation? Deleted ""Suggestion invoking"" from the issue ::You are right. ""_Ctrl+f12_"" stands for ""**Go to Implementations**"". It wasn't clear for me that test verified movement to String.class implementation.::What about adding that devfile to our test repo in this PR? It would solve the problem with files in private repos, it would be also clear and visible what is the version control etc. So you can e.g. add it to `e2e/files` folder that already exists there. You should be able to access raw content easily (example for already existing yaml in the folder: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/che/master/tests/e2e/files/happy-path/containers-happy-path.yaml)::I already explained that on this stage I don't want to do that. I will change these files frequently and I don't see any advantages of adding temporary files to the official repo.::If we have an official test for that file (correct me if I'm wrong, but this test will fail without this particular file), then it should be official too IMHO. I don't see any problem with creating PR more often for updates :) ::I don't agree that it ""should"" be official, it may be official and may be not. Tests still on the development stage. And I repeat at the 3rd time that devfiles will be changed frequently. And I see a problem related to delays if I add them to the official repo.::And to your information, we don't have ""official"" tests yet. They are not exposed anywhere. As I mentioned several times tests are on the development stage.::Not using private repos is a common best practice. We are working towards that direction all the days - that's why we're using bots accounts etc. > And I repeat at the 3rd time that devfiles will be changed frequently. I'm not blind, I can read :wink: Even if you would repeat that 10 times, I would not agree with having that in private repo. >Currently stage of proof of concept, and I need to have as much flexibility as possible. If the stage is Proof of concept - why are you then trying to merge the test to master? Why are you not keeping that just in your branch till it's ready for merge? ::If test is in development state, I would rather not merge it into the master branch.::I agree with Katka's and Dmytro's points. If this is not ready, let's not merge it. If it's ready, let's have the yaml in our repo.::Thank you for your opinions, fix implemented.::@Ohrimenko1988 : > Deleted ""Suggestion invoking"" from the issue ""Suggestion invoking"" is still in the issue description: ![Screenshot from 2021-03-30 16-28-58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1197777/112997495-d70bad80-9175-11eb-87af-ab5f758b3e75.png) ::Done.::",be1505bb6f41b45937173a8a8f71d1c7b3d647cc::d9958262888a51f0c9c28effef438fbf1fa1e47d::9d1c750597631e9c6ceff38b813481d6cbe813a0::39fb067388c68d14a799ba4380793850c3546696::84be5e459a70b598ce42cfe96dfb847d4a3e1519::

I tried testing this from https://github.com/eclipse/che/actions/workflows/release.yml via the create-gh-release-when-releasing branch but it never accepted the CHE_BOT token so was always rate limited. Hoping that's because it was from a topic branch rather than master branch. If we merge this, we can validate that theory, then we can call this action from che-release so that it fires only when the release is done (after chectl?), rather than when che server is done. ### PR Checklist [As the author of this Pull Request I made sure that:](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-template-and-its-checklist) - [x] [The Eclipse Contributor Agreement is valid](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-eclipse-contributor-agreement-is-valid) - [x] [Code produced is complete](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-produced-is-complete) - [x] [Code builds without errors](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-builds-without-errors) - [ ] [Tests are covering the bugfix](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#tests-are-covering-the-bugfix) - [x] [The repository devfile is up to date and works, if one exists](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-repository-devfile-is-up-to-date-and-works) - [x] [Sections What issues does this PR fix or reference and How to test this PR completed](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sections-what-issues-does-this-pr-fix-or-reference-and-how-to-test-this-pr-completed) - [x] [Relevant user documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [x] [Relevant contributing documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [x] [CI/CD changes implemented, documented and communicated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#cicd-changes-implemented-documented-and-communicated) ### Reviewers Reviewers, please comment how you tested the PR when approving it.::",de1b90891b37f98b34ab8ad9aa3c27955f38f77f::0e4bb57064359447472d0ca01aeaded4c170caa0::

I don't like this change from private to public on a method that does not need to be public.

In long, consistency. Everywhere else in the code, we use PreferencesHandler's public method that we implement for a specific purpose, which also allows us to do some extra logic around it. E.g.: you could implement your use case as ``` public async setShellcheckPathPreference() { const shellcheckExecutablePathPropertyName: string = 'shellcheck.executablePath'; const shellcheckExecutablePath: string = '/bin/shellcheck'; await setPreference(shellcheckExecutablePathPropertyName, shellcheckExecutablePath); } ``` and call it in your test as part of `test('Create workspace using factory'` ``` { await preferencesHandler.setShellcheckPathPreference(); await driverHelper.navigateToUrl(factoryUrl); } ``` which would make it consistent with the rest of the codebase. setPreference was an internal method of the class that shouldn't be accessed from the outside. for your second point, you can do search for all the other methods from PreferencesHandler in the codebase and replace them with raw preferenceHandler.setPreference calls if you want to have it as a public method. I really don't like that we're introducing fragmentation into the code as it makes it harder to debug and maintain.::Thank you Tibor, but from your post I can't get answer to my questions: - which problem resolves the private ""setPreference"" method and why not use it directly - why I need to create a dedicated method for one particular test, which will not be reused, in the common pageobject. In my eyes it look like not a very right approach. ::I haven't read whole slack conversation about this... But looking at the PR and arguments written here I personally think `setPreference` method should be public and should be used as much as possible (but current usages of the other methods shouldn't be changed in this PR). I personally think that havin extra method for each separate preference we might want to configure doesn't scale and thus this approach should be used only in rare circumnstances, where there would be some other logic involved (a.k.a. don't create methods just as a  ""named"" wrappers for `setPreference`). In most of the cases it's ok to call `serPreference` directly from tests or other places, as the arguments should pretty much cover what preference is being set (thus no need to have separate method for this in here)::I'm unblocking this change after our discussion on BlueJeans, Method will be changed to public and we will create a new issue to track the removal of wrapper methods. (Possible issue for Intern), feel free to resolve this thread once the issue has been opened.::Thank you @ScrewTSW  here is an issue: ""Get rid of wrappers in the ""PreferencesHandler"" class"" https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/19208::Extracted to the test with an informative name::Reworked: ``` // The simple "" character as a result.

Use other test stories for reference.::It is not possible because in the near future plugins tests amount will be extended and it would be nice to have an ability to run all tests and the single test. The same mechanism already exists for devfiles ``` ""test-all-devfiles"": ""./generateIndex.sh && ./initDevfileTests.sh"" ```::I'm -1 for adding new bash scripts too. All that logic can be done (and IMHO should be done) using a mocha framework.   E.g. like it's done here: https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/tests/e2e/mocha-all-devfiles.opts::Okay, let's imagine that we have 3 plugins tests: - Kubernetes - Xml - Yaml How I can launch one particular test using only mocha? ::There are few things we might and probably should do here. Instead of writing bash scripts and keep using deprecated mocha-opts, we could just simply create `.mocharc.js` as described here: https://mochajs.org/#configuring-mocha-nodejs and put our custom logic (about which spec files should get executed when) there. I've just quickly tried to bash down simple POC how this works and it seems to be working quite well. For example this simple `.mocharc.js`: ``` 'use strict'; // Here's a JavaScript-based config file. // If you need conditional logic, you might want to use this type of config. // Otherwise, JSON or YAML is recommended. var specArray=[] if (process.env.SPEC_PATH){ var completePath='dist/tests/'+process.env.SPEC_PATH+'.spec.js' console.log(""Adding test file to run: ""+completePath) specArray.push(completePath) } module.exports = { diff: true, extension: ['js'], package: './package.json', reporter: 'dist/driver/CheReporter.js', 'full-trace': true, timeout: 2200000, ui: 'tdd', spec: specArray }; ``` Runs test based on `SPEC_PATH` env var.::@rhopp With all my respect it looks like a separate task, it doesn't match to the topic of this PR. We can find a bunch places which also may be improved but I don't think that I have to do that in the current task content. ::Thank you guys for your comments. I agree with the approach that Radim suggested but I also agree that it may increase the time spent on this PR. As we don't want to support bash scripts (and get rid of them if possible) I would not add a new one. Instead, you can create a mocha file, that will run only your case if you need that and call that from the package.json. [1] And we should prioritize the implementation of using the mocarc.js in the next sprint, so we will have a proper way how to run one/multiple/all tests as we choose ASAP. There is already an issue with that https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/15627. [1] https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/tests/e2e/mocha-factory.opts::@Katka92 +1::@Katka92 So let's make it clear (not to mix all suggestions) Do you confirm that this is impossible? https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/19139#discussion_r581964080::No, you can use only mocha - as e.g. for the factory test does: here file with mocha config: https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/tests/e2e/mocha-factory.opts and in package.json you use it like that: https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/tests/e2e/package.json#L19 It basically skips the part where you have the bash. I agree that it is not ideal but it should be gone next sprint. :) If some of us take https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/15627::1. Create `my-mocha.opts` like this: ``` --timeout 1200000 --reporter 'dist/driver/CheReporter.js' -u tdd --bail --full-trace ``` 2. create your own script in package.json, `scripts` section: `""my-mocha-test"": ""tsc && mocha --opts my-mocha.opts"",` 3. run it: ``` npm run my-mocha-test -- --spec dist/tests/login/Login.spec.js --spec dist/tests/plugins/${USERSTORY}.spec.js ```::@Katka92 So your answer means ""yes it is impossible"", because creating a separated config for each test is a workaround of your approach.::Okay, so only @rhopp suggestion left. https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/19139#discussion_r581977069 I agree is a valid suggestion. This additional task I can estimate at least 1/2 of a day (searching information, implementation, testing) But is it has enough severity for investing time on this stage? I guess it is a question of priorities. ::I see you already created `mocha-single-devfile.opts`. Is there a reason why to not use this?::@rhopp Ok, let me check, looks good. https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/19139#discussion_r582019920 ::Implemented https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/19139#discussion_r582019920 @ScrewTSW could you please close this ""Request Changes"".::",b58a654171e1e76e8cf6d550f15a58d53b7769b2::29c1abb58f14d985ef2e4aa2f531683bcb7f7f95::ae946f382a802d9b71689f0b9f3c74cae146a53b::8ccf768e7a7130badbdb7a62afceeb0b3146f632::b9dda43088cba466f62d0f3d94745a2243122e3e::

One of the configured repositories failed (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server - os (RPMs)), and yum doesn't have enough cached data to continue. At this point the only safe thing yum can do is fail. There are a few ways to work ""fix"" this: 1. Contact the upstream for the repository and get them to fix the problem. 2. Reconfigure the baseurl/etc. for the repository, to point to a working upstream. This is most often useful if you are using a newer distribution release than is supported by the repository (and the packages for the previous distribution release still work). 3. Run the command with the repository temporarily disabled yum --disablerepo=rhel-7-server-os-rpms ... 4. Disable the repository permanently, so yum won't use it by default. Yum will then just ignore the repository until you permanently enable it again or use --enablerepo for temporary usage: yum-config-manager --disable rhel-7-server-os-rpms or subscription-manager repos --disable=rhel-7-server-os-rpms 5. Configure the failing repository to be skipped, if it is unavailable. Note that yum will try to contact the repo. when it runs most commands, so will have to try and fail each time (and thus. yum will be be much slower). If it is a very temporary problem though, this is often a nice compromise: yum-config-manager --save --setopt=rhel-7-server-os-rpms.skip_if_unavailable=true failure: repodata/repomd.xml from rhel-7-server-os-rpms: [Errno 256] No more mirrors to try. https://pulp.dist.prod.ext.phx2.redhat.com/content/dist/rhel/server/7/7Server/x86_64/os/repodata/repomd.xml: [Errno 14] HTTPS Error 410 - Gone + true + sudo yum install -y glibc.i686 libfontconfig.so.1 libstdc++-devel.i686 Loaded plugins: product-id, search-disabled-repos, subscription-manager This system is not registered with an entitlement server.

I am not so familiar with /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo to configure it properly. Anyway, as you can see [in the logs](/etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo) installation is ending up in pulp repo. > Also aside, am I crazy or does i686 == 32 bit? should we be using x86_64 instead?::1. From your log: ``` Delta RPMs disabled because /usr/bin/applydeltarpm not installed. ``` You might be able to enable delta rpms and get better install performance by fetching smaller files :) 2. Are these glibc and fontconfig deps because you're doing e2e tests that need them? As you can see from the CRW build script https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/codeready-workspaces/crw-jenkins/-/blob/master/jobs/CRW_CI/crw-server_2.7.jenkinsfile#L182-184, I've had to *disable all the tests* ... ``` mvn -DskipTests clean install ${MVN_FLAGS} -P native -f ${CHE_path}/pom.xml ${MVN_EXTRA_FLAGS} ``` as they wouldn't run (for 2.6, anyway). I haven't re-enabled them yet for 2.7 to see if they're more stable. Oh, but I see you're using the same `skipTests` !! ``` + mvn clean install -f /mnt/hudson_workspace/workspace/dashboard-next-happy-path/pom.xml -T 4 -U -DskipTests -Dskip-enforce -Dskip-validate-sources ``` So I'm really curious what needs these c/c++ deps. What are we compiling against i686?

The TS_SELENIUM_LOAD_PAGE_TIMEOUT is more general constant and uses for different load page (CheLoginPage, OcpLoginPage, etc.) So I would prefer to have the TS_SELENIUM_START_WORKSPACE_TIMEOUT in this method as a permanent value. ![create-and-open-ws](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5408906/108205684-146c2c80-712e-11eb-88a3-c64f5f63fb43.png) ::I see.

Can we avoid it?::imo that comment about override rules is still useful; may we keep it ?::Such name is hardly giving idea that this is an utility class. Sounds more like a POJO or data object for me. Can we add an verb, like DevfileVersionDetector\Extractor\Retriever\... ?::For production code I agree. But this is test code. In production code, we call `createFactory` and don't further care what's inside returned data object. We only do few more steps with it and return it from the service https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/wsmaster/che-core-api-factory/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/api/factory/server/FactoryService.java#L102 So we do not need to cast.

personal access token. Must return {@code null} if scmServerUrl is not applicable for the ```::deletePersonalAccessTokens throws a lot of checked exceptions. It will not look pretty.::Is this place is where we will end up if the OAuth is not configured? In that case we need another exception type here, because OAuth flow is starting when we see that user in not authorized on BB (`ScmUnauthorizedException`), and than we try OAuth, found it broken and again same exception. This will be hard to process correclty. My proposal is to throw `OAuthAuthenticationException` as is, and since it is subclass of `ServerException` it will be processed well and end up with 500 error on the REST. Or at least rethrow separate one. ::? is it copy-paste?::I would put static variables first, above the class properties::empty line::when can this happen? shouldn't we `LOG.info` it? or even throw an exception?::can we put `Client` in the name?::can use method reference::can use method reference::can you please describe in javadoc or inline comments what all is happening here? It's quite complex process with some server requests and it's hard to see why some steps are needed. - why we're using slugs ? (what are slugs?) - why try to search twice in two different sets?::`Server.` or `Servers` ? :)::I see that `findCurrentUser` is making at least 2 requests to bitbucket server per item in the set. How many entries are we expecting here (and line 90)?::move timeout value to constant::`doGetItems`, `doGetPage` and `executeRequest` does not feel like Bitbucket specific methods. Does it belong here? Can we reuse it somewhere else if we move it out?::why is it ok? what happened if we got here? Shouldn't we log?::you're creating new HttpClient in each method. Might that be a resource issue? How high traffic do we expect here?::I think `trace` is more appropriate to log individual http requests::`function` parameter isn't much descriptive. What is it good for ?::trace::can we use http code constants from `HttpURLConnection` or Apache's `HttpStatus`? It is more descriptive than remember all numbers.::does not feel related to bitbucket::move LOG up::Wouldn't ConfigurationException be more appropriate here?::ConfigurationException::ConfigurationException::sounds reasonable to me::NO. That is the real author of the code.::it can happen if no Bitbucket integration is configured and we have NOOP implementation of bitbucketServerApi.::>Is this place is where we will end up if the OAuth is not configured? No. That would happen in `BitbucketServerOAuthAuthenticatorProvider` and `BitbucketServerApiProvider`. We will have `NoopOAuthAuthenticator` and `NoopBitbucketServerApiClient` if Bitbucket OAuth1 is not configured.  In this case, an instance of  `BitbucketServerOAuth1AuthorizationHeaderSupplier` will not be created. However, you might be right `ScmUnauthorizedException` might be a wrong reaction on `OAuthAuthenticationException` (As far as I can see it can happen if `java.security.GeneralSecurityException` is thrown)   what about `ScmCommunicationException ` or `UnknownScmProviderException` ?::`ScmCommunicationException` sounds reasonable enough imo::done.::10-90-X.

The message ""Invalid usage of NoopOAuthAuthenticator"" would suggest to me that there is some kind of valid usage, but there seems to be none. What about ""NoopOAuthAuthenticator can't be used for authentication"" or maybe even better something like ""The fallback noop authenticator cannot be used for authentication.

https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse/che,18691,feature/tolerations::master,0,merged,kind/enhancement::,"### What does this PR do? This PR is adding support for k8s tolerations for workspace pods.  Taints and tolerations can be used for many things, but here is why I need those: _Node selectors & labels_: when setting a selector on a pod, it is good to look for nodes with those labels.  But it won't prevent pods without that selector to be executed on that node. _Taints and tolerations_: if you set a taint on a node, only pods that are tolerating that taint can be executed.  The taint will protect the node from unwanted pods. In my setup, I use a dedicated node pool in my k8s cluster for user workspace pods.  Only Che workspace pods will be executed there and nothing else.  I make that pool grow and shrink as my number of users increases or decreases.  I also use Azure SpotVMs (to lower cost) and those have a taint set by Microsoft.  So I need my pods to tolerate the SpotVM taint because otherwise, they are never scheduled to run on those. Here is the [associated doc PR](https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs/pull/1780). ### Screenshot/screencast of this PR In order to use tolerations, you can add them to the helm value (for now, planning to add Operator support later): ```yaml cheWorkspacePodTolerations: - key: ""a.node.taint"" operator: ""Equal"" value: ""aValue"" effect: ""NoExecute"" ``` Helm will convert the YAML into a JSON string, which is then passed as a property to Che. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/13319 ### How to test this PR? You will need to use the helm installer since I didn't add Operator support.  In order to see the toleration in action, you will also need to add a taint on your k8s node.

With other plugins here like `che.workspace.devfile.default_editor.plugins` or `che.factory.default_plugins`, we're using `/nighly`, so why it is an issue here?::it's an issue because nightly plugin definition uses a 'latest' image https://github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-registry/blob/master/v3/plugins/eclipse/che-async-pv-plugin/nightly/meta.yaml#L26 While other nightlies plugins use a `nightly` tag image https://github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-registry/blob/master/v3/plugins/eclipse/che-machine-exec-plugin/nightly/meta.yaml#L27 so the plug-in should not be called nightly, only latest, but as long as che reference the 'nightly' version (which is a latest and didn't get any changes since 4 months) we can't remove 'nightly' in plug-in registry::to me it feels more like `che-async-pv-plugin` issue, that has no released tag. In other words we're now using `:latest` image on production, which can be updated anytime and break stuff. Shouldn't we rather follow other plugins, make proper release tag, put the tag into the `latest.txt` and keep nightly as cutting edge?::> In other words we're now using :latest image on production, which can be updated anytime and break stuff. > Shouldn't we rather follow other plugins, make proper release tag, put the tag into the latest.txt and keep nightly as cutting edge? why do nightlies on a component that is not updated since 4months ? It will add extra work on release and produce new images that do not changes. For plug-in broker that is not updated often, we're using tags. And in parallel we can still create an alias of the image. But it's no longer an issue on this repository. For example CRW uses digest of images at build time so even if it's `:latest` it's replaced by a digest ::on our end we are currently working on making the async storage images UBI based, in order to include this in product, and indeed there are some moving parts with the async-storage release cycle. We can technically release the `0.0.1` version of the plugin, add it to the registry + make it latest and refer to it from che-server.::because once someone will need to change anything and will not know about all this, he/she might break things for others production deployments. CRW yes, but what about other live systems, like che.openshift.io? It uses nightly now and I don't like an idea to change an image that is used in live production systems.::@ibuziuk that's fine but we can still merge this PR as each release of che has its own plugin registry so Che 7.24 can have latest (latest being 0.0.1) and Che 7.25 still using latest (but here latest could be 0.0.2)::> CRW yes, but what about other live systems, like che.openshift.io?

Taking step back, from che-server point of view, it's ok for me to use `latest`. I think using `next`/`nightly` would be better because it's the general practice for similar plugins.But we would need to adapt this plugin release cycle first...

https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse/che,18611,che-configmap-checksum::master,0,merged,kind/enhancement::,"### What does this PR do? Currently when you modify the configmap (like adding a new env variable), or change the value of an env variable (change the value in a values.yaml), the pod will not be restarted and you have to manually do a rollout restart. This can introduce a configuration mismatch and it is not in line with k8s/helm philosophy. A change in the config should automatically issue a restart. This PR adds a checksum value in an annotation so that if the configmap changes, the spec of the pod will also change and k8s will trigger a restart. This is a documented way (see Automatically Roll Deployments section) of fixing that issue. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? Fixes the issue reverted by this PR: https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/18603 ### How to test this PR? Using the helm installer, simply change a value that is used in the configmap and the che pod (or the plugin/devfile registries) should restart. ### PR Checklist [As the author of this Pull Request I made sure that:](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-template-and-its-checklist) - [x] [The Eclipse Contributor Agreement is valid](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-eclipse-contributor-agreement-is-valid) - [x] [Code produced is complete](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-produced-is-complete) - [x] [Code builds without errors](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-builds-without-errors) - [ ] [Tests are covering the bugfix](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#tests-are-covering-the-bugfix) - [ ] [The repository devfile is up to date and works](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-repository-devfile-is-up-to-date-and-works) - [ ] [Sections `What issues does this PR fix or reference` and `How to test this PR` completed](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sections-what-issues-does-this-pr-fix-or-reference-and-how-to-test-this-pr-completed) - [ ] [Relevant user documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [ ] [Relevant contributing documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [ ] [CI/CD changes implemented, documented and communicated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#cicd-changes-implemented-documented-and-communicated) ### Reviewers Reviewers, please comment how you tested the PR when approving it. ::",e918ee4f1a254c4543f0933515086977559f9b60::5aa43f39f15a9e85aa37ac88649242d3e671ab79::a047a08bb241e94837a852f4ec4968b1d355cdde::54b0bb87929e5081d73fc3e7c7c164b95c17d057::0dd1c47e730614d4cea3432b07b0b11d79d9fcb7::9b78875187e82e1ae92f5469e9ba792fe0413d79::00a97635ecab0664de9ef02e69537e123386c5a7::

https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse/che,18600,configmap-checksum::master,0,merged,kind/enhancement::,"### What does this PR do? Currently when you modify the configmap (like adding a new env variable), or change the value of an env variable (change the value in a values.yaml), the pod will not be restarted and you have to manually do a rollout restart.  This can introduce a configuration mismatch and it is not in line with k8s/helm philosophy.  A change in the config should automatically issue a restart. This PR adds a checksum value in an annotation so that if the configmap changes, the spec of the pod will also change and k8s will trigger a restart.  This is a [documented way (see Automatically Roll Deployments section)](https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/) of fixing that issue. ### How to test this PR? Using the helm installer, simply change a value that is used in the configmap and the che pod (or the plugin/devfile registries) should restart. ### PR Checklist [As the author of this Pull Request I made sure that:](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-template-and-its-checklist) - [x] [The Eclipse Contributor Agreement is valid](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-eclipse-contributor-agreement-is-valid) - [x] [Code produced is complete](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-produced-is-complete) - [x] [Code builds without errors](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-builds-without-errors) - [ ] [Tests are covering the bugfix](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#tests-are-covering-the-bugfix) - [ ] [The repository devfile is up to date and works](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-repository-devfile-is-up-to-date-and-works) - [ ] [Sections `What issues does this PR fix or reference` and `How to test this PR` completed](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sections-what-issues-does-this-pr-fix-or-reference-and-how-to-test-this-pr-completed) - [ ] [Relevant user documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [ ] [Relevant contributing documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [ ] [CI/CD changes implemented, documented and communicated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#cicd-changes-implemented-documented-and-communicated) ### Reviewers Reviewers, please comment how you tested the PR when approving it. ::",e918ee4f1a254c4543f0933515086977559f9b60::5aa43f39f15a9e85aa37ac88649242d3e671ab79::a047a08bb241e94837a852f4ec4968b1d355cdde::54b0bb87929e5081d73fc3e7c7c164b95c17d057::0dd1c47e730614d4cea3432b07b0b11d79d9fcb7::9b78875187e82e1ae92f5469e9ba792fe0413d79::3ed9592a58757a8b9af8b3e760d42b2a66107507::

https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse/che,18562,images-runtime-update::master,0,merged,kind/question::,"### What does this PR do? This PR will port already existing functionality from both `che-devfile-registry` and `che-plugin-registry` to `che`. When ever we use `che` in an air gapped network, we need to change the images path in plugins and devfiles.  I think this feature exists when `che` is deployed by the operator, but it does not when the installer is helm.  This PR makes che's helm chart support this. It also adds support to override some images, which is a must in an air gapped setup: - CHE_INFRA_KUBERNETES_PVC_JOBS_IMAGE - CHE_WORKSPACE_PLUGIN__BROKER_METADATA_IMAGE - CHE_WORKSPACE_PLUGIN__BROKER_ARTIFACTS_IMAGE - CHE_SERVER_SECURE__EXPOSER_JWTPROXY_IMAGE ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/18436 `--set che-devfile-registry.cheDevfileRegistry.image=""non-existing""` can be used to set the image of a custom devfile registry that you have built a priori.  With this, you can use which ever image you'd like.  The problem is your custom image has references inside it about other containers, VScode extensions and source code locations.  The `build.sh --offline ...` script will pre-package VSCode extensions and source code zips into the custom image, **but not the containers references**.  Those container locations will still be set `quay.io` or any other container registry, which obviously won't resolve in an air gapped setup. This PR is changing the locations of those containers at registry startup.  That's the only time you can do that since you do not want to bake those changes at build time since it will make your custom image not portable. ### PR Checklist [As the author of this Pull Request I made sure that:](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-template-and-its-checklist) - [x] [The Eclipse Contributor Agreement is valid](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-eclipse-contributor-agreement-is-valid) - [x] [Code produced is complete](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-produced-is-complete) - [x] [Code builds without errors](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-builds-without-errors) - [ ] [Tests are covering the bugfix](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#tests-are-covering-the-bugfix) - [ ] [The repository devfile is up to date and works](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-repository-devfile-is-up-to-date-and-works) - [ ] [Sections `What issues does this PR fix or reference` and `How to test this PR` completed](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sections-what-issues-does-this-pr-fix-or-reference-and-how-to-test-this-pr-completed) - [ ] [Relevant user documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [ ] [Relevant contributing documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [ ] [CI/CD changes implemented, documented and communicated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#cicd-changes-implemented-documented-and-communicated) ### Reviewers @tolusha Reviewers, please comment how you tested the PR when approving it. ::@tolusha I need your opinion for the following.  Since the names of the values are all over the, place, I thought we could simply leverage the property names used internally by `che`.  For example in [PVCSubPathHelper.java](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/infrastructures/kubernetes/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/workspace/infrastructure/kubernetes/namespace/pvc/PVCSubPathHelper.java#L95) ``` @Named(""che.infra.kubernetes.pvc.jobs.image"") String jobImage, @Named(""che.infra.kubernetes.pvc.jobs.image.pull_policy"") String imagePullPolicy, ``` So no need to be smart and figure out which helm values maps to what.  And it makes it in line with the env variable name too.  The one catch though is you need more code in helm to check for null values.  You need to make that check at every `.` or node.  It might not look too good when you only have 1 value like I have right now, but once you start and group all the values together, you end up with blocks of values...  You can use helm's `with` directive or `if` like I did firther down this file (see line 161 where I set `CHE_SERVER_SECURE__EXPOSER_JWTPROXY_IMAGE`). It's only a proposition, feel free to reject it and I'll adapt this PR accordingly.::That's an interesting question. I don't have answer right now.::As far as I understand we will have to following in values.yaml ``` che: infra: kubernetes: pvc: jobs: image: <..> server: secureExposer: jwtProxyImage: <..> ```::@cccs-eric I personally tend to this: ``` che: infra: kubernentes: pvcJobsImage: <..> server: secure: exposerJwtProxyImage: <..> ``` I will raise a question in che-dev@eclipse.org mailing list::I have updated my code with what you proposed.  I had to use a few nested `if` to make sure the tree of values (the parent nodes) exist.  As I said earlier, it would be nice to re-group those under the same `if` to avoid testing the parent nodes each and every time.  But that should go in another PR.::After discussion with @sleshchenko  we decided to flatten the fields and follow this pattern in the future. So, pls update the PR with `cheInfraKubernentesPvcJobsImage` and `cheServerSecureExposerJwtProxyImage`::Just a bit more context: Che Server environment variables have autogenerated documentation https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/installation-guide/advanced-configuration-options-for-the-che-server-component/ And the idea is to put all Che Server configuration that is propagated to the config map to one field(not necessarily declare all on them in values.yaml). Then helm template for config map will be simpler: it will just put all items in a loop in Config Map data. We don't need anyone to contribute every single env var into helm chart, users are able just to provision a new value with --value parameters, or contrinute a new value with values.yaml file, I suppose. + we can reuse the same documentation for free So, I see value.yaml like the following: ```yaml che: customProperties: # name can be different. It's not too custom, so just properties or advanced_cfg, or something else CHE_INFRA_KUBERNETES_PVC_JOBS_IMAGE: '...' CHE_SERVER_SECURE__EXPOSER_JWTPROXY_IMAGE: '...' ``` ::Yes, that makes a lot of sense.  It would make the chart aligned with what is going on in the Operator.  It should be fairly trivial to implement.  The only thing we would lose is the possibility of adding logic in the configmap like: ``` if valueX is set, then set valueY ``` but for those cases, the value could come from the chart values (like we are doing now).  But I don't think this would happen often (if it ever does).::",e918ee4f1a254c4543f0933515086977559f9b60::5aa43f39f15a9e85aa37ac88649242d3e671ab79::a047a08bb241e94837a852f4ec4968b1d355cdde::54b0bb87929e5081d73fc3e7c7c164b95c17d057::0dd1c47e730614d4cea3432b07b0b11d79d9fcb7::9b78875187e82e1ae92f5469e9ba792fe0413d79::dd697b68323c725a492ad7f0e381b51754cc3ea0::8541171a79c751c16e3e58206d6f6d9f66a32865::5e260889939536a4c830ffc771c3cdf942c8f13d::f968db3689cb27f666bb20c39abd740d08ea2e0c::fa95b1a1f3604e214298bb54287c144432226146::40bfe612bfa62a37c4c9390f0efeca6d158c90a3::cadff7d2f8107b52c35ed0fe9d411dd9e2f73462::

https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse/che,18506,master::master,0,merged,kind/enhancement::,"### What does this PR do? Currently the only supported ways of configuring the `admin` user of Keycloak are: 1. Set its username and password via helm values 2. Leave the default `admin`:`admin` and mark them as `to be changed` at first login. This PR is introducing a new way to inject the username and password using a Kubernetes secret, which make this more secure than passing values in the clear in helm values.  It is adding this new way and keeping the other ones also.  To create a secret recognized by the chart, you would do the following: ``` kubectl --namespace ${NAMESPACE} create secret generic keycloak-admin-secret \ --from-literal=user=admin \ --from-literal=password=XXXXXX ``` and then in your values.yaml: ``` che-keycloak: keycloakCredentialsSecret: ""keycloak-admin-secret"" #requireAdminPasswordChange: true #keycloakAdminUserName: admin #keycloakAdminUserPassword: admin ``` The PR also adds a new global value to configure `quay.io/eclipse/che-endpoint-watcher:nightly` image to something else, which is useful if you are using Che's helm charts from the repository and not from `chectl`.  Otherwise, you cannot change the image and you are stuck with the nighlty build. ### How to test this PR? In order to test this, you can create a Che deployment using its helm chart.  You could also modify `chectl` to create a Kubernetes secret with the random password it generates and then `--set che-keycloak.keycloakCredentialsSecret=keycloak-admin-secret`.  In my opinion, modifying `chectl` in this regard would be a good idea. ### PR Checklist [As the author of this Pull Request I made sure that:](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-template-and-its-checklist) - [x] [The Eclipse Contributor Agreement is valid](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-eclipse-contributor-agreement-is-valid) - [ ] [Code produced is complete](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-produced-is-complete) - [ ] [Code builds without errors](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-builds-without-errors) - [ ] [Tests are covering the bugfix](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#tests-are-covering-the-bugfix) - [ ] [The repository devfile is up to date and works](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-repository-devfile-is-up-to-date-and-works) - [ ] [Sections `What issues does this PR fix or reference` and `How to test this PR` completed](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sections-what-issues-does-this-pr-fix-or-reference-and-how-to-test-this-pr-completed) - [ ] [Relevant user documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [ ] [Relevant contributing documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [ ] [CI/CD changes implemented, documented and communicated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#cicd-changes-implemented-documented-and-communicated) ### Reviewers Reviewers, please comment how you tested the PR when approving it. ::```suggestion #keycloakCredentialsSecret: che-identity-secret ```::```suggestion {{- if .Values.keycloakCredentialsSecret }} ```::```suggestion name: {{ .Values.keycloakCredentialsSecret }} key: user ```::```suggestion name: {{ .Values.keycloakCredentialsSecret }} key: password ```::I am not sure if we need default since we have it in `values.yaml`::You are right, but I thought some defensive programming wouldn't hurt.

Che needs to use the usernames as part of K8s object names and labels and therefore has stricter requirements on their format than the identity providers usually allow (it needs them to be DNS-compliant). The adjustment is represented by comma-separated key-value pairs. These are sequentially used as arguments to the String.replaceAll function on the original username. The keys are regular expressions, values are replacement strings that replace the characters in the username that match the regular expression. The modified username will only be stored in the Che database and will not be advertised back to the identity provider. It is recommended to use DNS-compliant characters as replacement strings (values in the key-value pairs). Set the value of this prooperty to `NULL` to turn this feature off. Example: `\\\\=-,@=-at-` changes `\` to `-` and `@` to `-at-` so the username `org\user@com` becomes `org-user-at-com`.::Is the example actually correct? Wouldn't it have to be `\\=-,@=-at-` when written in the property file as opposed to the java string?::you are right.

Also, if I understand the purpose of this property correctly, it is only there to distinguish bitbucket from github by forcing the two to only match different hosts. IMHO that is a rather limiting approach. It needlessly limits the factory to only support single hostname per ""repository type"". Wouldn't it be better to try to somehow figure out what kind of server it is when determining the validity of the URL by e.g. trying to deduce an endpoint which would reveal what type of server it is? E.g. github could be detected by trying to access `<API_HOST>/octocat`, bitbucket could be determined by trying out a URL specific to its API and if we get auth error we may assume it is bitbucket, if we get 404, it is not a bitbucket server. Alternatively (or rather, in addition), we could just let the user tell us what kind of server she points to with the URL sent to the factory. ::Other modules seem to set this to `false`. Any hard reason to diverge here?::Again, this is not the general purpose feature. it is about to satisfy the concrete customer request. If you have read description, it is clearly says that this implementation ONLY for indiviual onprem installations, so i can hardly imagine someone have 2 or 3 different bitbuckets in their ""private"" network. IMO no much sense to write an heuristic analyzis of the servers when it will be never used in such way (because it you set CRW for your on-prem BB, you will 99% probably not need another one, and even github too).::```suggestion private final BitbucketURLParser bitbucketURLParser; ```::`bitbucketUrlPattern` is set only if `bitbucketEndpoint != null`, but it's called in the methods, which will result in NPE.::can we make it final?::what about not add bitbucket at all, when it is not set in configuration?::I would consider the thing that @metlos suggested only as a fallback option, because it might significantly increase the factory resolution time. So it could be something like ""we know these factories, this is how we can detect them from url string only. If not found, then try some super-smart autodetection"". However, I agree with @mshaposhnik that it is different issue. Anyway, making this property multiple endpoints should be straight-forward. Just make it comma-separated list of endpoints and separate in the `BitbucketURLParser` constructor. Or is there more complexity?::Conditional binding in general is an antipattern of guice. Moreover, it's hard/impossible to do in general(only if you rely on env variables.).::Added check::So guys let's imagine how the future OAuth  and secrets configuration for multiple servers will look like (that's what i know at the current state and can predict. Maybe there will be something else): 1) servers URL-s for factory detection: `bitbucket.servers.endpoints=bitbucket-1.com, bitbucket-2.com` During factory resolve, we will jus try tot match them one by one. 2) OAuth conf for each server: Server 1: ``` bitbucket.endpoint=https://bitbucket-1.com oauth.bitbucket.consumerkey=key1111 oauth.bitbucket.privatekey=MII....<long key>...Fdh= ``` Server 2: ``` bitbucket.endpoint=https://bitbucket-2.com oauth.bitbucket.consumerkey=key2222 oauth.bitbucket.privatekey=a8da....<long key>...ssd= ``` So, of course it will not work that way, and we also cannot put some variable part into property key (like `oauth.bitbucket-1.consumerkey=..`). So in that case, we need to think about complete move this configuration into other place (to the NS secrets ?) And from code part, we will be not able to bind multiple OAuth authenticators of the same type, they will have to be somehow stored in lists and find corresponding on demand. 3) Storing of personal tokens and Git secrets: So from what was proposed at research, personal token secrets should be also marked for which server it is, and should have unique names: ``` apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: bitbucket-personal-access-token-secret-bitbucket-1.com labels: app.kubernetes.io/part-of: che.eclipse.org app.kubernetes.io/component: bitbucket-personal-access-token annotations: che.eclipse.org/expired-after: 12323423 che.eclipse.org/bitbucket-userid: 34593094509 che.eclipse.org/bitbucket-username: 'tshevchenko' >>>  che.eclipse.org/bitbucket-server-url: 'https://bitbucket-1.com' data: token: ZHNhZmFkZmFzZGZxMzRyMzRyMTM0 ``` so probably we will need and retrieve all and filter by correct hostname.  The same is applicable for Git credentials secret. @skabashnyuk @metlos ::I think that delegating the configuration to Namespace Secrets, with proper labels and annotations to match them, is feasible and elegant solution of this. Still question what to do with public servers, that will not require private Secrets.::@sparkoo If you mean OAuth configuration... it won't be easy anyway, that conf should be created in the Che server namespace, and OAuth java components (authenticators etc) have to be able to read this conf at server startup time (as they do that when reading from che.properties).::I like the idea to store server ulr https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/18423#discussion_r529737860 in secret.  We can reuse it later. I think we can skip the idea of multiple endpoints at this stage.::> and OAuth java components (authenticators etc) have to be able to read this conf at server startup time (as they do that when reading from che.properties). why would they have to do it on startup? Why not on demand (with some ttl'd cache)?::I share @sparkoo 's sentiments about this - IMHO storing the config as secrets/configmaps is both consistent with how we store other info and more flexible for the admins...::Maybe i am somewhat old-minded, but for me creating the authenticators and other stuff ""on-the fly"" (means, actually, when user clicked a factory and waits for redirect to provider auth page) by reading the secrets is little inconvenient. It may be boring long, it may fail, and it cannot be stored in Guice (since injector already initialized). So we will need  to keep them somewhere and manage by ourselves.::I'm a bit lost here. I must admit that I don't fully understand how oauth with bitbucket works, but my assumption was that every user has to have personal auth token.

I decided to change the name because old one does not reflect real purpose of it.::@skabashnyuk do you have a specific case in mind where it is useful? To me it is a list of trusted CA certificates for Che installation that should be trusted by Che server and components as well as by all workspaces. And this is how it works now for Openshift infrastructure.::Yes, it is. Will do that.::the use-case is to have all provisioners at the same place. Do you have use case for why it should not?::Do we need to port these changes to downstream to keep files in sync @tolusha @nickboldt?::@skabashnyuk no, `kc_realm_user.sh ` is executed when Eclipse Che is deployed by helm For other cases we do everything on operator side https://github.com/eclipse/che-operator/blob/master/pkg/deploy/identity-provider/deployment_keycloak.go#L154-L157 ::Since the doc says `path on workspace containers`, is it a good idea to add workspace word in property name?::Are `bundles_configmap` and `workspace_bundle_configmap` named in different way (bundle & bundles) by purpose?::I'm a bit confused. Is it for Che Server or Workspace, or both?::This property specifies the path on which CA bundle config map should be mounted inside container. This is done for all workspace containers as well as for plugin brokers. I may add the word `workspace` if you think it is useful there.::> Are `bundles_configmap` and `workspace_bundle_configmap` named in different way (bundle & bundles) by purpose? Yes, they are. `ca.bundles_configmap` contains several CA bundles (that's why `s`). `workspace_bundle_configmap` is a merged (from bundles above) bundle which is propagated inside workspaces via mount from single config map.::> I'm a bit confused. Is it for Che Server or Workspace, or both? Short answer - for both. `che.trusted_ca.bundles_configmap` is for Che server and is located in `che` namespace. `che.trusted_ca.workspace_bundle_configmap` is a copy of `che.trusted_ca.bundles_configmap` but in a workspace namespace (for workspace containers and plugin brokers).::Instead of `che.trusted_ca.` I would recommend consider: `che.infra.kubernetes.trusted_ca` or`che.workspace.trusted_ca.` as configuration domain And config properties then: `{DOMAIN}.configmap` <- config map in Che Server namespace to configure workspace trust stores. `{DOMAIN}.dest_configmap` <- Is managed by Che Server. Admin needs to configure it only in case it conflicts with the already existing config map. `{DOMAIN}.dest_config_map_labels` `{DOMAIN}.mount_path` @skabashnyuk Do you have any preferences here?::I'm not decided yet. So how the properties should look like?::I'm a bit more for `infra.kubernetes` since we are configuring configmap which is stick to k8s. So, then as an example `che.infra.kubernetes.trusted_ca.configmap` ^ if we don't care that we may have different infras from k8s or OS, then I'm fully OK with `che.workspace.trusted_ca.configmap`, and maybe even I like it more because it's simpler.::I think, I'll go with `che.workspace.trusted_ca.*`::I have changed my mind and decided to go with `che.infra.kubernetes.trusted_ca.*` because we have infra specific labels.::Please consider moving these parameters to `### Kubernetes Infra parameters` section::Should Che Server care about it? I think things will be even more simplified if we have one only k8s_infra.labels property where Che Operator injects `config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle=true` when Che is deployed on the OpenShift 4.x. But I may be wrong and maybe you have in mind some deployment different from Che Operator.::> then cluster CA bundle will be propogated too that really depends on https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/18377/files#diff-deca31b9cca47d5b0356dd75fc0fd0c8cb980f3aa029da27b475bdbb37353eb0R519 If admin will need to configure labels for dest-configmap, and override inject-ca, it won't be true. But this statement makes an impression at least for me, that it's handled by Che Server itself, independent from which labels are configured.::```suggestion # Name of config map in Che server namespace with additional CA TLS certificates to be propagated into all user's workspaces. ``` propogated appears in other places as well.::sure::I think it should, because Che server does provision of a workspace.

Both the Kubernetes and OpenShift runtime infrastructures use the same impl - they only differ in the http client used. That's why I called this ""helper"".::This is implemented only for OpenShift. Maybe this should throw `UnsupportedOperationException` or some such.. Good point.::this is our chance to have our own `unsafe` and I like it maybe more than `unsupported`. WDYT?::Not sure. The endpoint is not really unsafe, we only allow it when it is safe to do so. But IMHO we do want to stress that this is a temporary measure. I thought about `experimental` - but that could stay for eternity without raising eyebrows. `unsupported` on the other hand would have those eyebrows raised, I hope :smile: ::can you move this line to https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/74e4f757166d30a19dd296dfa601cdd0f30d05b0/assembly/assembly-wsmaster-war/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/api/deploy/WsMasterModule.java#L263 ?::What do you think about `JsonNode body -> String body` or Reader body?::`JsonNode body` -> `@HttpHeaders headers, InputStream body`::do we really need this new dependency? Are licenses compatible?::Do we need to convert headers to string and back again in constructor called on next line?::I would rather use `javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType` to construct the media type, then hardcoded string.::You've defined `headers` as `@Nullable` in method signature, but this will imho NPE on line 107 https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/18367/files#diff-56db0564cf344b9fe5dc822c7f2c97981605658e3981db1f1792840c60db254fR107::can you please name `bld` better? `responseBuilder` ?::I would split this method to at least 2 private methods, one handling the preparing and maybe executing the request, second managing the response.::`headersBuilder` ?::javadoc::Can we get `""openshift""` string into some constant in some common place?::We have a policy in our poms that requires to explicitly declare any dependency the code uses. `okio` is a transitive dep of `okhttp` and I happen to use one of the classes in the codebase now. So this is not a new dependency, it's just an explicitly re-declared transitive one.::Yes. I wanted to avoid the upper layers to depend on `okhttp` that is a sort of implementation detail of the kubernetes client. So inputs and outputs of this method are from `javax.ws.rs` while the impl uses `okhttp` so that it can reuse the connection (and authz setup) of the kubernetes client.::Since I need to convert that to `okhttp` header, I don't see much reason for that.::Sharp eyes! :+1: ::I see, I didn't noticed it's different `MediaType`.::I don't like the header in hardcoded string. What about something like this? ``` String mediaType = headers.getMediaType() == null ? APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE.withCharset(StandardCharsets.UTF_8.name()).toString() : headers.getMediaType().toString(); ```::I would hazard to say that the API of the MediaType and StandardCharsets types is more likely to change than the mime format. I'm all for indirection but in this case I don't think it is warranted. The hardcoded string is IMHO both more stable and readable than the API-generated alternative.::I'm not sure it is worth it. Remember that we want to eventually get rid of this API.::",9d77530328e716438b4031c14ba74be228472279::0c8a647e6a8967d340fb78c4775a65bb09108b69::5e330a1cb7876ddf25d8d63f7c5c92c4fc1dc7b7::997245bf7f2a9bd53442924bd457f149978a2b28::33380a683f6cf1dbd051e9e562fde6765ee8c269::8a682f5aadb096fc6a10d3a954cbb19d45bb5a31::bc6397ac0f7079ac61937deaf3b54ebcaa67edd5::168c29bb34ad23fbdbb0633c99b1dbfed233868b::f1d1a22d48f10ac9ff15c32a13e8068b68d016bd::ac03a5c34041f42db214cc905e189723ad8f6838::a7a05a3190223741dabae6d51150f64281504f82::9477ce1820e36b482139c19ee8b55b241b9e5de3::3dbce68fd66ddd7858311058a1a18aabe59822e4::b8388f43cc4efa0f1b5defa736865f896c336b58::2d27cd6af7ff493441e35ae12bb458ab49a60a9e::0f43372e66d4d644cae749b98f349b7d9041b7c5::

It should work. ### PR Checklist [As the author of this Pull Request I made sure that:](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-template-and-its-checklist) - [x] [The Eclipse Contributor Agreement is valid](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-eclipse-contributor-agreement-is-valid) - [x] [Code produced is complete](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-produced-is-complete) - [x] [Code builds without errors](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-builds-without-errors) - [x] [Tests are covering the bugfix](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#tests-are-covering-the-bugfix) - [x] [The repository devfile is up to date and works](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-repository-devfile-is-up-to-date-and-works) - [x] [Sections `What issues does this PR fix or reference` and `How to test this PR` completed](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sections-what-issues-does-this-pr-fix-or-reference-and-how-to-test-this-pr-completed) - [ ] [Relevant user documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [x] [Relevant contributing documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [x] [CI/CD changes implemented, documented and communicated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#cicd-changes-implemented-documented-and-communicated) ### Reviewers Reviewers, please comment how you tested the PR when approving it. ::`evaluatedAnnotationValue` or `evaluatedValue`?::`annotationName`?::yes::fixed::",2268e68746456ae5d5461be51b98813da4046191::84facc07f4a79ab6763fba49b2966c076d83d60e::b7562bc2933a7adc7b0a9b3391106333188f36b1::9cbb82f530cadfca85b2473c447b296d1a716888::2621f5e10e91fc9b7b520ef20a72b09db6bdbff1::0d467228e46944d8a907263cbb4698c223559704::9adb89ac2047ad8522576f4efc5508c6aa101186::

This differs from the original #18121 by injecting the `ServiceExposureStrategyProvider` into `JwtProxyProvisioner` and `PassthroughProxyProvisioner` and using that to pick the configured exposure strategy + the bound multi-host strategy. This makes sure that we pick the correct multi-host strategy implementation based on the infrastructure. This then avoids the problem reported in #18157. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? #18065 #18157 ### How to test this PR?

Maybe instead it makes sense to introduce async method to remove user? It'll mark user as inactive(not able to create/start more workspaces), stop all workspaces, and remove user along with all related objects once workspaces are stopped? It seems to be more complex than the proposed solution but I just don't understand how this PR is going to work. I think in most cases users will still get error because of try to remove non-stopped workspace.::Looks like you are totally right. How could miss that :(?  But i don't understand why it works for me on test cluster. As have proposal to add method to the WorkspaceManager like `stopAndRemove()`, it will remove workspace after stop. What do you think? @skabashnyuk @sleshchenko  ::Maybe that's OK to stop every workspace asynchronous and throw an exception like `User had running workspaces which now are marked as stopping. You'll be unblocked to remove user when all workspaces are stopped. Please try again` Also throw similar error when user has STOPPING workspaces.::> As have proposal to add method to the WorkspaceManager like stopAndRemove(), it will remove workspace after stop. I don't think that's good idea because remove user is a synchronous request that typically will be timed out by clients in pretty short time while stop workspace is potentially can occupy like up to 5 minutes.::Can we extract this to the private method and add a javadoc (it is also used in the `tryStopWorkspaceWithSA`)::I still don't know how the made changes could help avoid 500 error. We may improve UX a bit if we after one loop (remove or stop with remove workspace) - will check if there are no more workspaces. If there are any STOPPING - throw exception `409 - The user has stopping workspaces. Try again`::we discussed with @vparfonov this part and indeed if there are ""STOPPING"" workspaces we should encourage to do the retry explicitly::Technically it's `tryStopAndRemoveWithSA`::I wonder if it's a good idea to always stop workspace with SA? Maybe the current user does not have permissions to the corresponding namespace anymore and if so - it could help to avoid a situation which cannot be handled by Che Admin.::```suggestion /** The flag for removing a workspace after it's stopped */ ```::Will throw Conflict Exception::done::@skabashnyuk WDYT?::fixed::accepted ::fixed::It was just an assumption ) I'm not sure Che Server SA always has the corresponding permissions. But it should, otherwise stopping by activity would not work I believe::`of()` is very non-descriptive. Would IMHO read better if this was `Map.of(...)`.::How does this behave on OpenShift with OAuth?

Allow using precreated namespaces labeled with proper labels. The labels are configurable with `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.labels` property. ### Documentation PR https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs/pull/1643 TODO: - [x] Make labeled namespace as a valid namespace for creating new workspace (TODO in KubernetesNamespaceFactory.java) - [x] Javadocs - [x] Tests - [x] Documentation ### Screenshot/screencast of this PR <!-- Please include a screenshot or a screencast explaining what is doing this PR --> ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? <!-- Please include any related issue from eclipse che repository (or from another issue tracker). Include link to other pull requests like documentation PR from [the docs repo](https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs) --> https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/17842 ### How to test this PR? <!-- Please explain for example : - The test platform (openshift, kubernetes, minikube, CodeReady Container, docker-desktop, etc) - Installation method: chectl / che-operator - steps to reproduce --> 1. create namespace with labels `app.kubernetes.io/part-of=che.eclipse.org,app.kubernetes.io/component=workspace,che.eclipse.org/username=<username>` and make sure your user has access to it (`admin` role) 1. On OpenShift with OAuth, it should be enough just to create RoleBinding for the user and `admin` role in pre-created project. 1. On Kubernetes, you will also need to add list namespaces clusterrole permission to `che` serviceaccount. 1. login to Che with the user 1. go to create new namespace page 1. you should see the namespace name in the dropdown ""Namespace"" 1. when you use factory to create a namespace, this labeled namespace will be used 1. when you label more namespaces, all will be shown in dashboard. If you use factory with more labeled namespaces, the first one will be used (should be alphabetical order, but not guaranteed) ### PR Checklist [As the author of this Pull Request I made sure that:](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-template-and-its-checklist) - [x] [The Eclipse Contributor Agreement is valid](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-eclipse-contributor-agreement-is-valid) - [x] [Code produced is complete](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-produced-is-complete) - [x] [Code builds without errors](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-builds-without-errors) - [x] [Tests are covering the bugfix](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#tests-are-covering-the-bugfix) - [x] [The repository devfile is up to date and works](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-repository-devfile-is-up-to-date-and-works) - [x] [Sections `What issues does this PR fix or reference` and `How to test this PR` completed](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sections-what-issues-does-this-pr-fix-or-reference-and-how-to-test-this-pr-completed) - [x] [Relevant user documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [x] [Relevant contributing documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [x] [CI/CD changes implemented, documented and communicated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#cicd-changes-implemented-documented-and-communicated) ### Reviewers Reviewers, please comment how you tested the PR when approving it. ::Why this limitation?

Allows endpoints to be forcefully exposed on subdomain in single-host mode. It's done by endpoint attribute `forceSubdomain` set to `true`.

I see moving the `code navigation` test to line 42 as the easiest solution for that. Applies for all other test files.::That would have the opposite effect and the timeout would have to be even longer. By the time the tests get to codeNavigation the LS is still not initialized. Moving it to the front would create even bigger unnecessary wait and prolong the test run.::So that means that even the tests of LS like `error highlighting`, `autocomplete` etc are failing now, right? ::for some reason, it's just the code navigation that's being affected.::To me, it seems like quite a flaky approach. Also, what about increasing `TimeoutConstants.TS_EDITOR_TAB_INTERACTION_TIMEOUT` instead of changing the code in every test class? The reverting of the workaround should be easier then.::I believe it's easier to just remove the custom timeout variable and not change it for all tests including happy path. This way once the tasks exit code is reimplemented, we can just remove the timeout::Ok, so leave the comments there so it is clear then :) Thank you for the discussion.::",a226dac90433906601b77a67f5d9739d07811eff::

This changes the default implementation of the secure servers authentication to ""jwtproxy"". The previous default was a mere passthrough, which offered no che-provided authentication at all. This PR also consolidates the secure server behavior of plugins and other workspace components. Before, the plugins and editors were authenticated using jwtproxy regardless of how what the `che.server.secure_exposer` said. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? #17852 ### How to test this PR? 1. Deploy a fresh che server built from this branch. 1. Deploy a new workspace using the below devfile. 1. Make sure that endpoint works and is correctly authenticated 1. Start the quarkus application in devmode 1. Open web tools in the browser 1. Click on the endpoint link 1. In the network tab of the web tools check that the auth flow has happened and that the final request to the endpoint page has its authorization cookie set. ```yaml metadata: name: test-for-17852 projects: - name: quarkus-quickstarts source: location: 'https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts.git' type: git sparseCheckoutDir: getting-started components: - id: redhat/quarkus-java11/latest type: chePlugin - mountSources: true endpoints: - name: hello-greeting-endpoint port: 8080 attributes: cookiesAuthEnabled: 'true' path: / secure: 'true' memoryLimit: 4927M type: dockerimage volumes: - name: m2 containerPath: /home/user/.m2 alias: centos-quarkus-maven image: 'quay.io/eclipse/che-quarkus:nightly' env: - value: >- -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=50.0 -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=10 -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=20 -XX:GCTimeRatio=4 -XX:AdaptiveSizePolicyWeight=90 -Dsun.zip.disableMemoryMapping=true -Xms20m -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Duser.home=/home/user name: JAVA_OPTS - value: $(JAVA_OPTS) name: MAVEN_OPTS apiVersion: 1.0.0 commands: - name: Start Development mode (Hot reload + debug) actions: - workdir: '${CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT}/quarkus-quickstarts/getting-started' type: exec command: './mvnw compile quarkus:dev' component: centos-quarkus-maven ``` ### PR Checklist [As the author of this Pull Request I made sure that:](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-template-and-its-checklist) - [x] [The Eclipse Contributor Agreement is valid](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-eclipse-contributor-agreement-is-valid) - [x] [Code produced is complete](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-produced-is-complete) - [x] [Code builds without errors](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-builds-without-errors) - [x] [Tests are covering the bugfix](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#tests-are-covering-the-bugfix) - [x] [The repository devfile is up to date and works](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-repository-devfile-is-up-to-date-and-works) - [x] [Sections `What issues does this PR fix or reference` and `How to test this PR` completed](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sections-what-issues-does-this-pr-fix-or-reference-and-how-to-test-this-pr-completed) - [x] [Relevant user documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [x] [Relevant contributing documentation updated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#relevant-contributing-documentation-updated) - [x] [CI/CD changes implemented, documented and communicated](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#cicd-changes-implemented-documented-and-communicated) ### Reviewers Reviewers, please comment how you tested the PR when approving it. ::Looks like you can do `MapBinder<String, SecureServerExposerFactory<? extends KubernetesEnvironment>>`, can't you? to move all map binders out of `if` cond.::I would maybe prefer to call it `Noop` instead of `Fake`?::would be nice if possible::Unfortunately this wouldn't work because of type literals - you need the full generic type params to be able express the bindings, so there is going to be an if sooner or later somewhere.

Introduces new property `che.infra.kubernetes.singlehost.workspace.devfile_endpoint_exposure` (effective only if `che.infra.kubernetes.server_strategy=single-host`) with options `single-host` and `multi-host`. When is set to `multi-host`, the devfile public endpoints are exposed on subdomains using dedicated Ingresses/Routes, instead of using subpath as other single-host endpoints. `single-host` keeps endpoints on subpaths. The subdomain devfile endpoints are exposed on HTTP only, because the lack of wildcard certificate for subdomains when using single-host strategy. This has limitation that preview can't be opened directly in editor's window, but must be opened in separate browser tab.

Any other places?::Is it OK to have such method here? Just to avoid duplicating of validation regex somewhere else..::I'm not sure this works well. `a-b#-hello` would be reduced to `a-bhello` (I think) which I am not sure is correct - I would have assumed `a-b-hello`. But overall I'm not sure if removing the invalid chars is better than replacing them with some placeholder (and making sure that the name is valid after the replacement).::You're right, but i'm not sure if we should implement a complex logic to be 100% precise, for me not big difference between in result of `a-bhello-jsb786` and `a-b-hello-jkh762`, it anyway be faintly readable. (but if we can reach that easily it would be good). About placeholders...what we can use, imo only ""-""  -s ? Does it really makes sense to have them like `a-b---hello--jkh762` and the iterate couple of times? ::In a lot of cases, an invalid name would be a valid email. So lets imagine how `blah@gmail.com` would look better - `blahgmailcom-jfk3434` or `blah-gmail-com-jfk3434`. Anyway, `dash` on a first position has to be removed one way or another. I vote 40%-60% for the second variant. We can even put this replacement character in the configuration. Also, this name has to be stored somewhere. In user preferences for example.::you're using testng with junit assertions. please change this to testng::when changed to testng assertions, parameters are swapped::please use DataProvider when testing with multiple values. it's easier to debug which case failed and easier to run them separately.::can we please limit this loop to some finite number of tries and fail in case it runs out?

Also `isValid` does not work properly, see failing examples above::> can we please limit this loop to some finite number of tries and fail in case it runs out? It's a bit scary like this. That would either mean there are at least 6^36 namespaces present - each for the 6-char randomization applied to the name - or that the Java's random number generator does not have a uniform distribution. I would call both of those more scary than the possibility of an infinite loop here :)::what's wrong with: ```java StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(namespaceName); // remove invalid characters at the start of the name while (!sb.isEmpty()) { if (!isValidNamespaceNameStartOrEnd(sb.charAt(0))) { sb.remove(0); } } // corner case handling if (sb.isEmpty()) throw AreYouKiddingMeException(); if (sb.length() == 1) return sb.toString(); // replace characters in the middle of the name with '-'. int idx = 1; do { if (!isValidNamespaceNameChar(sb.charAt(idx))) { sb.replace(idx, idx+1, ""-""); } } while (++idx < sb.length()); // remove invalid characters from the end of the name while (!sb.isEmpty()) { if (!isValidNamespaceNameStartOrEnd(sb.charAt(sb.length() - 1))) { sb.remove(sb.length() - 1); } } // corner case handling if (sb.isEmpty()) throw new AreYouKiddingMeException(); // done return sb.toString(); ``` ```java boolean isValidNamespaceNameStartOrEnd(char c) { return (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z') || (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z') || (c >= '0' && c <= '9'); } boolean isValidNamespaceNameChar(char c) { return c == '-' || isValidNamespaceNameStartOrEnd(c); } ``` The above is just as quick and IMHO more comprehensible than inverted regexes, etc.::I'm more worried about our failures, like `fetchNamespace` method is wrong (e.g. some wrong refactoring), or some bug in `NameGenerator`, or even here with modyfiing the namespace name to test...::As this seems to be a good stretching exercise in the morning, here's my impl :D ``` public static String normalize(String namespaceName) { namespaceName = namespaceName.replaceAll(""[^-a-zA-Z0-9]"", ""-""); // replace invalid chars with '-' namespaceName = namespaceName.replaceAll(""-+"", ""-"");  // replace multiple '-' with single ones namespaceName = Strings.trimLeadingCharacter(namespaceName, '-'); // remove all '-' in the beginning namespaceName = Strings.trimTrailingCharacter(namespaceName, '-'); // remove all '-' in the end return namespaceName.substring(0, Math.min(namespaceName.length(), METADATA_NAME_MAX_LENGTH)); // limit length to METADATA_NAME_MAX_LENGTH } ```::Mine would run circles around yours performance wise but since this is never gonna be run 50000 times per second, a :+1: from me as well :)::I don't think so, this looks like infinite loop for me once it has valid character in the beginning :) ``` while (!sb.isEmpty()) { if (!isValidNamespaceNameStartOrEnd(sb.charAt(0))) { sb.remove(0); } } ``` I agree that we could do something more performant, but I would choose readability here. Considering the fact, that we could fit like million iterations of this in one fetch namespace request to k8s API...::`new Object[] {""--ab--"", ""ab""},` I think ^ is gonna fail.::added such case ::what are the benefits of using crc32 over using the string directly?::We never need the actual value; we need only fact it is cnanged (or not). So this is more compact storing form (like timestamps etc). If you need to track file content change, will you store whole file? No.. Don't  forget it will be stored into preferences of each and every user. Also direct exposing of the template value may have security concerns under some circumstances? (questionable). ::I don't see security reason of eventual exposing template from this. You're storing it before placeholder evaluation, so it's just copy of che-server configuration value from the time workspace was created. With compact string, yes it's ""probably"" shorter. Considering default `<username>-che`, which has crc32 value `3677644488`, we save 4 bytes per user. I can't imagine number of users that would make this number even close to save something significant and didn't cause us issues somewhere else. When the template is `<username>`, we save exactly nothing. When template is `<userid>`, we even waste 2 bytes. So memory saving is uncertain, because the source string is typically short. It's limited by kubernetes boundaries, which we know is reasonably short. What we know that it cost CPU time to compute the hash. Both is so negligible that I don't see a reason to calculate hash here. With tracking file content change, you're right. But we're not comparing files that could have megs or gigs. We know we have string that is <100 characters and complicate stuff for humans reading the code, just to save few bytes, does not make sense here in my opinion. my vote goes to prefer readability and simplicity here.::do we need to store the namespace if it does not have any placeholder? a.k.a. single namespace for all workspaces strategy.::Templates is not always as short. At least it can be `che-<userid>-<workspaceid>` etc. About exposing, agree it not a big secret, but anyway its kind of showing system-wide admin setting for end user.::Imo for consistency is better to always save if `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.allow_user_defined` is `true`::>my vote goes to prefer readability and simplicity here. +1::This is a minor nitpick. More of an observation than change request. I like optionals for their composability. E.g. mapping them to other types, etc. We're not doing that here - we're just using it as a wrapper for a nullable value. Also, optionals are IMHO more usually used in the public API of types than in just private implementation details. So what about just handling the `Pair<String, String>` as a nullable value and saving 1 allocation?::IMHO storing the value in the user prefs would warrant a separate method. Are you sure this method is always called from the contexts that have a user id recorded in their environment context?::This is called from `evaluateNamespaceName(NamespaceResolutionContext)` which contains the intended user ID/name, yet we're relying on the environment context to fetch that info here. I remember that I had problems with this, because the namespace evaluation might be called from contexts that don't have a proper user set up in the environment context, e.g. workspace recovery.::you mean i should get it from NamespaceResolutionContext ? ok...::i know at least one guy who will be unhappy with nulls :)::I have changed getting user from NamespaceResolutionContext instead of EnvCtx. Is thet waht you meant ?::I don't think saving 1 allocation will improve anything here. However, the code here looks a bit overcomplicated. I would maybe move the `allowUserDefinedNamespaces` check to `getPreferencesNamespaceName` method, and rename `namespaceOptional` to `storedNamespace` ?::",2992f15cfb0e8b5c7a5850889f3fc078109c0739::7205402d80a7bc28a2dc7249ae45720c7b957d7b::8b76adea48b30e76f7ccb8bde3767fba1b36918f::dacb65230b0b079a1ea5c99271d6008800954227::bdfef7f255099ff7d854a0e46242444f394a7c0a::c1b74ab78ad8888dec71f552189044f9f84b1bc8::e2799e2e40b835e40f54607d960a44c9f76cb5ca::39e21cae6b7ac0efa8e06813eb567d56b9c095f2::266b02c4a99f9d9310503097d7e62d803c9bd1d4::fdd9c7b5c5b51f28beb06b19fa184a49904718af::1f3a5d16dbb98321901c2c1aef723a9d27e2f16a::f7586a950fd245ed8a6c1fd4992c822befaf6c7d::9d81619b4e1a2e2ebba93b25d44aff2eca661354::ffc18c60a57c11e5540bdca95a1d2a2572de4aaf::2e6a9881bc6de940cd9a6d1876db63687ceaf9bd::f581249bf5b4b664ff8da07930916b916b04f699::e63908fbf802a2463cc67425d5f0d9cca5d7a013::

One `devfile/devfile/` is used to create persistent devfile from yaml. The name would be generated randomly. - For compatibility reasons method `GET /devfile` left untouched. It returns devfile 1.0 schema. Method `GET /devfile/list` is used to enumerate and search for devfiles. ## TODO for Phase 2 -  update CascadeRemovalTest, add userdevfiles cascade removal  https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/17911 -  REST API to get by namespace `  @Path(""/namespace/{namespace:.*}"")`  https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/17911 -  Replace get by ID with  get by composite key `  @Path(""/{key:.*}"")`.

It is highly confusing to use the same name for completely different things in the model and in the infrastructures. What about calling this `ownerName` or `accountName`?

We should make sure (as much as comments allow) to not shoot ourselves in the foot in the future by allowing unsanitized string in the query.::We usually use constructor injection.::This is technically indenpendent of the Jpa dao.

The former is the name of the ""template"" from which you create new workspaces using the devfile contained in it.

We can debate about usefulness of that when we only have kubernetes-based runtimes, but we should start changing the flow without a broader discussion (of which I am unaware). I recommend following the common approach and kudos to @sparkoo for spotting this. ::So in this case we will shutdown AsyncStorage service with stopping/restarting workspace configured to use Async Storage feature::@metlos @sparkoo I mean that we don't need to stop `AsyncStorage` immediately on workspace stop, that's why I don't add it to the `KubernetesEnvironment`. We need to introduce ability to not stop marked Pods/Deployments on workspace stop.

First I create configmap without any data, but with all the annotations/serverconfig-attributes in `GatewayServerExposer`. `TlsProvisioner` then may update the annotations (protocol).

Implements Traefik based Gateway configuration on Kubernetes. ❗ This PR introduces one breaking change. This class https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/17557/files#diff-8855fac8bb68d106dd25037d440a3e22 (previously was `OpenShiftCheInstallationLocation` https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/infrastructures/openshift/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/workspace/infrastructure/openshift/environment/OpenShiftCheInstallationLocation.java) now fails when neither `KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE` or `POD_NAMESPACE` is set. Previously it returned null. The reason for it is that we need to know che installation namespace here and can't work without it so we should fail fast (at startup). The installers (che-operator, helm) are responsible to set one of these env variables. If there will be any failures, it should be fixed on their side. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/17060 <!-- #### Changelog --> <!-- The changelog will be pulled from the PR's title.

We could use `ObjectMapper`, but then we would need to create all objects in configuration yaml or use multiple levels of `Map<String, Map<String, Map<...`. So I don't think it's so bad... Or any better idea? ::namespace!!!::get the port in more safe way::I'm not sure I can use `path` of ServerConfig here::I afraid you will face the permission problem accessing che namespace, which i have faced during search of CA configmap.::good point. I'm afraid we would have to somehow create that configmap in namespace with gateway pod. If we won't have permissions for that, we would have to add it. I'll look what permissions we have and if we need more. Alternatively, we could configure configbump to watch configmaps on all namespaces, or namespaces with running workspaces, which would require higher permissions on configbump SA.::Would it be a big problem to require the che SA to be able to crud configmaps in the che namespace?::it works with current helm install (we use `cluster-admin`). With operator, we currently can't use different namespaces anyway because lack of permissions and in one namespace it works fine. So last option is OpenShift OAuth. I didn't try it, but this task is about Kubernetes so I would leave this potential permissions issue to https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/17061::""che"" namespace is hardcoded should we use something like OpenShiftCheInstallationLocation?::Throw InfrastructureException + 1::test::test::test::test::javadocs, tests::javadocs::test::javadoc::done::fixed::done::done::done::done::done::done::done::done::done::This would be better included in this changeset as a `git mv` rather than deleting the earlier file.::Easier to understand if we return emptyList here.::This name suggests that this singleton could be used generically, but it's not the case. It is essentially a helper for `KubernetesInternalRuntime`. While it is very good to split out functionality into separate classes, I'm not sure we need a managed bean for a util class. ::Shouldn't a check of this kind be done at the very start of the provisioning? How can it fail given the codepaths in which this utility class is used?::The error message doesn't reflect that the status may be something different than ""starting"".::I think the keys in the map are the file names and values are file contents, but IMHO that's not obvious from this description.::checking owner and workspace status kind off bounds it with `InternalRuntime`, yes. I wanted to do this so this class is harder to misuse. I can remove the check and then it will be more generic. Then it will be caller's responsibility to ensure it's safe to use. WDYT? I would still keep it as managed bean, because I can't imagine how would pure utility class create somehow kubernetes client in some reasonable simple way. We need client factory for that https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/17557/files#diff-b4b75036fe50ab1fd958324baffac440R31::in this scope, yes.

In general, UX should be improved for vanilla idling in the first place Makes sense, I didn't dig deep enough to get the idea why we had that limit. If it's really big like 5-8h - then I agree that UX would be affected too much. ::> From UX perspective I suppose it would be nice to see a warning when like there are 3 minutes left before workspace is shutdown... Is it correct that this would require a che-theia change?::> Is it correct that this would require a che-theia change? I suppose - yes. But as discussed with Illya - the only thing that makes sense to do with that in the current PR - create an issue for CheServer/Dashboard/Che Theia to improve UX when workspace is stopped by run_timeout or idle_timeout.::1. it would be interesting to see `EXPLAIN` of this query to figure out missing indexes. 2. :runTimeout > 0 - I think it would be better to split this query on two.  Orginal `SELECT a FROM WorkspaceActivity a WHERE a.expiration < :expiration` and current and execute it depending of the value of `runTimeout` 3. if runTimeout > 0 query may look like `WHERE a.expiration < :expiration OR (a.status = org.eclipse.che.api.core.model.workspace.WorkspaceStatus.RUNNING AND a.lastRunning< :X)  I assume it would be easier for DB to optimize. Anyway we need to see `EXPLAIN`::IMO it worth clarifying a couple of things: - 0 = disabled by default - what time unit is expected to be used in the property (milliseconds probably ? similar to what is used in the `che.limits.workspace.idle.timeout` )::the proper detailed explanation of the property is important since it will automatically generate the docs - https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/advanced-configuration-options-for-the-che-server-component/#che-server-component-system-properties-reference_advanced-configuration-options-for-the-che-server-component::Updated the documentation to clarify these points::Expain results old ``` QUERY PLAN ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Index Scan using che_index_ws_activity_expiration on che_workspace_activity a  (cost=0.41..8.10 rows=1 width=82) Index Cond: (expiration < '1594228056124'::bigint) (2 rows) real	0m0.077s user	0m0.040s sys	0m0.020s ``` new ``` QUERY PLAN ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bitmap Heap Scan on che_workspace_activity a  (cost=8.88..33.34 rows=2 width=82) Recheck Cond: ((expiration < '1594228056124'::bigint) OR ((status)::text = 'RUNNING'::text)) Filter: ((expiration < '1594228056124'::bigint) OR (((status)::text = 'RUNNING'::text) AND (('1594228056124'::bigint - last_running) > 3600000))) ->  BitmapOr  (cost=8.88..8.88 rows=7 width=0) ->  Bitmap Index Scan on che_index_ws_activity_expiration  (cost=0.00..4.42 rows=1 width=0) Index Cond: (expiration < '1594228056124'::bigint) ->  Bitmap Index Scan on che_index_ws_activity_last_stopped  (cost=0.00..4.46 rows=7 width=0) Index Cond: ((status)::text = 'RUNNING'::text) (8 rows) real	0m0.080s user	0m0.040s sys	0m0.018s ```::@tomgeorge actually I forgot one important thingy - ideally, we want to have a log message when a workspace is stopped by the `che.limits.workspace.run.timeout` in order to identify and investigate this case which is likely to be an abuser. so @skabashnyuk proposal about splitting query into two is relevant::- remove `:runTimeout > 0` condition - replace `:timestamp - :runTimeout > a.lastRunnin` with `a.lastRunnin<X`::best practice in this part of the code is to avoid wildcard imports.::@tomgeorge the reason will be logged in the stopWorkspace e.g. (Workspace run timeout exceeded), right?::- select  a.workspaceId?

Can you provide `explain` of this query, please? Do we need an index on `a.status, a.lastRunning`?::I will change to return a list of strings instead of `WorkspaceActivity`, and will pass in the difference to the query. See the above explain plan.

Fixes error when  multiple K8S/OS components have `mountSources:true`. The causes of the error are: 1) PVC is created for each component, but must be only one for all; 2) During component recipe parsing, volumes and volume mounts with same names are injected, while they should have unique names. So the fixes are: 1) Merge projects PVC into sinlge one if already present; 2) ~During component parsing into envrironment, names of volumes and mounts named in form `projects-<pod-name>`.

I think It's better to avoid exception throwing/catching in non-exceptional situations. So, here is my +1 to avoid it here::Why do you decide this as non-exceptional situation ? i cannot understand.. We catch it and throw another one and break the flow...::> A safe code should not throw NPE. This code _never_ thows an NPE. > firstNonNull is supposed to be called with AT LEAST non-null argument. Not really true (or where do you read that?). Its just a question if the NPE thrown by this method is suitable. If it is supposed to continue execution of the branch, then i agree, NPE is not suitable. So to stop flame i'll rewrite it on streams, but still think this is quite acceptable code :- )::!?.... what is `p` ?::`but its was not specified` theres probably missing something. It's what was not specified?::what if secret has both env_name and template env_name annotation?::`but its was not specified`::does this apply also for `data < 1` ? I assume it's invalid state and its handled before calling this method.::Please javadoc this method. It's doing some non-trivial things and it would help to understand what's happening there.::please javadoc. I'd like to know what exactly it is doing, before digging into this complicated code.::what is the point of this? Can't we use just `mountPath` ?::please always javadoc abstract/interface methods, what should it do, how should it be implemented...::are you sure by this? Can `labels` be null? Is it ensured to be in correct format for this split?::typo `autonount`::p - array, the element of the stream. I propose to move this logic from collector to stream. ::for use in lambdas::this method is called for each data entry. So in there is no entries, it will simply not called::Ok, this feels wrong. Looking at the logic of the method, which is very complex, you set `mountPath` on the top, then if certain condition is met, you overwrite `mountPath`. What if next container in the loop does not met this condition, the secret will be mounted to overwritten path from previous container. Isn't it wrong? Shouldn't it be mounted into original `mountPath`?::i doubt it can be written simpler::can you write whole snnippet? i can't get the idea... (BTW `map()` it's mappping object->object, not object-> map entry)::>Can labels be null? Nope, it's not `@Nullable` so injector will require it > Is it ensured to be in correct format for this split? It's not necessary. If it is not contain `=` we will just look for label with given key. ::It will pick up first. Generally, i want to avoid to fail on each and every little error, because one bad secret can block all workspaces to start if they all share the same NS.::You're correct, will add per-container variabe.::this looks equivalent: ``` if ((component.isPresent() && isComponentAutomountFalse(component.get())) || (!component.isPresent() && !secretAutomount)) { continue; } ``` Or I'm ok to split it into 2 conditions for readability, something like: ``` // skip components that explicitly disable automount if (component.isPresent() && isComponentAutomountFalse(component.get())) { continue; } // skip when component not found and global automount disabled if (!component.isPresent() && !secretAutomount) { continue; } ```::can we log it then? preferably so it's visible workspace-loader log::ok::So it expects some state of arguments, but does not limit it programatically nor document it. Possible future caller of this method will need to dig in to discover this or cause possible bugs.::`!isComponentAutomountTrue(component.get())` isn't it same as `isComponentAutomountFalse(component.get())` ?::can we extract this mountPath detection to extra method? You then avoid having `mountPath`, `containerMountPath` and `finalMountPath` shufflery.::can it be final now and renamed to something like `mountPathAnnotation` ?::I would probably extract this block to separate method (something like `applyVolumeToContainer`) calling it in the loop. This method is already doing so many things...::are these methods ment to be overriden? Can we set them final ?::not exactly. they both return `true` only when property set explicitly. So when property not set, `isComponentAutomountFalse()` will return false,  when set to `false` it will return true. And here we need to check it is not set or ot is not true. So having different methods more straightforward.::Done, it is simplified things a little.::Not sure if it will help much..::Reworked the code, can you suggest how to log it properly to be visible on user-s console ?::https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/infrastructures/kubernetes/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/workspace/infrastructure/kubernetes/util/RuntimeEventsPublisher.java#L99::btw I would log it in che-server log as well.

As the title says, this enables to bind the workspace service account to more cluster roles, if needed. We already had an ability to bind to a single clusterrole using the `che.infra.kubernetes.cluster_role_name` property.

This is done just to have a more descriptive name for the config property. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? #17115 #### Docs PR None needed as this is going to pop up in the documentation autogenerated from `che.properties`.::```suggestion LoggerFactory.getLogger(AbstractWorkspaceServiceAccount.class); ```::Why don't fall through and create missing role/rolebinding if there out-dated/missing?

I don't think we should change it. - Q: Why do we need UserDevfile model object, we already have Devfile? - A: By analog with Workspace model object we need `id` to be able to uniquely identify persisted objects. - Q: Why JoinColumn was used in UserDevfileImpl? - A: It doesn't require additional filed in `Devfile` table or additional `table`. It might happen because DevfileImpl is used now it two places: WorkspaceImpl and UserDevfileImpl - Q: Is there any known issues with persistence. - Y:  Yes. `generateName` is not persisted. An alternative could be is to have separate UserDevfileImpl+ MetadataImpl. - Q: Why filtering restricted by `devfile.metadata.name` in JpaUserDevfileDao? - A: The idea is to identify during review necessary filtering and order fields and after that create DB indexes for them and make sure we can execute queries efficiently. - Q: Is this service would be available in multi-user mode? - A: Eventually yes. But not in this iteration. Before the merge, I'm going to restrict usage for single-user only. The reason for that is that we don't have any authorization mechanism available at this moment. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/16981 ::Is this actually used anywhere ?::Aren't we usually using Constructor injection?::does it make sense to save 1 byte with `usr` instead `user` ? :)::I don't like throwing an exception when not found.

This PR will introduce a new **_experimental_** feature which should provide fast I/O and give ability to persist your changes. In other words this is new kind of storage with fast I/O like in **Ephemeral Mode** but with saving changes like in traditional **Persistent Mode.** For  this we introduce special plugin which will be automatically added to workspace configuration in case user select this type of storage. Plugin will initiate restore command on workspace startup and backup all sources on workspace stop, also changes will be periodically backup during workspace is running (e.g. each 5 or 10 minutes). During restore procedure events with information about restore process sent via WebScoket connection and client (like Che Theia) can show this information in UI. For backup/restore procedure used rsync (https://rsync.samba.org/) via SSH connection. The special pod will start in OpenShift environment in user namespace, it will respond for storing files. In other words plugin it’s rsync client, storage pod - rsync server. Here initial for plugin and storage: [Initial contribution for workspace sync feature #2 ](https://github.com/che-incubator/workspace-data-sync/pull/2) For establishing secure connection special pair of SSH keys will be generated if they don't exist and mount to the plugin container (private part) and to the storage pod (public part). #### IMPORTANT: This feature at the moment will work only with [**_common_** PVC strategy.](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/infrastructures/kubernetes/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/workspace/infrastructure/kubernetes/namespace/pvc/CommonPVCStrategy.java#L40) If other (or current workspace) configured to the to use the traditional persistent mode, to prevent getting 'Multi-Attach error for volume' asynchronous storage pod will be shutdown. After deleting asynchronous storage pod procedure of starting workspace will be continued as usual. To try this PR you can use this devfile: ``` metadata: name: jerry-second-ws attributes: persistVolumes: 'false' asyncPersist: 'true' components: - id: che-incubator/typescript/latest type: chePlugin - mountSources: true endpoints: - name: angular port: 4200 memoryLimit: 1Gi type: dockerimage alias: nodejs image: 'quay.io/eclipse/che-nodejs10-community:7.12.1' apiVersion: 1.0.0 ``` Ready to use images: che-server: `vparfonov/che-server:0708` che-plugin-registry: `vparfonov/che-plugin-registry:0708` ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? <!-- #### Changelog --> <!-- The changelog will be pulled from the PR's title.

So if updating postgresql version is causing other overheads, I'll revert the changes for `9.6.17` as @benoitf has suggested. @benoitf I am able to build `che-postgres` docker image using both variants you suggested i.e. `docker.io/postgres:9.6.17-alpine` and `docker.io/postgres:9.6.17`.

CC @tolusha ::@skabashnyuk The `che-postgres` docker image built with `docker.io/postgres:9.6.17-alpine` is not compatible with the [scripts](https://github.com/eclipse/che/tree/master/dockerfiles/postgres). The [centos](https://github.com/sclorg/postgresql-container/tree/generated/9.6) Vs [alpine](https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/tree/master/9.6) postgres images are built with different methodology which makes them incompatible. This best possible approach is to extend `postgresql-96` docker image support to s390x. We have raised an [issue](https://github.com/sclorg/postgresql-container/issues/376) for this.::@skabashnyuk I came across [registry.redhat.io/rhel8/postgresql-96](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/detail/5ba0ad1f5a134643ef2eeb9d?architecture=s390x&container-tabs=overview) image which can serve the purpose. This is a RH subscription image. Earlier I thought that subscription image we may not be used but I came across this [commit](https://github.com/eclipse/che-machine-exec/commit/1ce224eb15cb339303fd1fecdafaad6d5f76cb0c) in `che-machine-exec` which uses RH subscription image.

BTW codeready uses `registry.redhat.io/rhscl/postgresql-96-rhel7:1-47`::@tolusha Thanks for the update. Yes the best way will be to get the image from centos but we haven't got any response from community on issue we raised for code contribution. The `registry.redhat.io/rhscl/postgresql-96-rhel7:1-47` which is used by CRW is unfortunately not multi-arch, so we don't have many options left other than using `registry.redhat.io/rhel8/postgresql-96` or adding multi-arch support to `centos/postgresql-96-centos7`. @nickboldt Could you please provide your inputs on using RH subscription image for postgres? Will it be OK?::@nickboldt Any update?::Note that `registry.redhat.io/rhscl/postgresql-96-rhel7:1-47` is single arch, amd64. We switched to `registry.redhat.io/rhel8/postgresql-96:1` to get support for Z and Power (it also includes arm).

There is also a prior art to this style of annotation declarations - the ingress annotations that are also defined by the user, yet they are prefixed, because they are specific to certain ingress controllers.::Prefixes was already agreed with Mario and applied. ::does it mean that `org.eclipse.che/mount-as=whatever` will be mounted as file? I'd maybe suggest to fail in that case, as it might silently behave differently than user expects. Also can it be mounted as both file and env with 2 annotations?::could you be more specific with `entry` variable name? Maybe `secretData`, or `secretDataEntry`?::unnecessary newline::I would rephrase that, `it has to be mounted as file` feels confusing to me.

Or it behaves how we expect...::are we ok with `.../mount-as: boo` being interpreted as ""mount as file""? IMHO, this should warn if the annotation is anything else but the supported values and only interpret the lack of the annotation as the default value - mount as file.::No. it can't::Unable to mount secret '%s': It is configured to be mounted as a file but the mount path was not specified.

I thing the answer -  yes. They are.::My follow up question would then be - why? :) Because there is no reason for that on SQL level... A transaction cannot have any effect on a single select statement without any joins apart maybe from a higher overhead ;)::I don't mind. I just want to make it looks similar to UserManager.  @mshaposhnik @sparkoo  @sleshchenko  wdyt?::I'm for consistency here so `getTotalCount()`. Or shorten it to `getCount()` or even just `count()` as word `total` or doubling word `workspace` imho does not add any descriptive value. And technically it's not getter either as count is not a property of the table, but rather it's current state of table's entries.::I'm not sure but I feel that you're probably right.  The alternative to transactional annotation would be  - usage of `com.google.inject.persist.UnitOfWork`. Which we are using in the test s but not in code. As a result, the code will like this. ```java @Inject private UnitOfWork uow; .... @Override public long getTotalCount() throws ServerException { uow.begin(); try { return managerProvider .get() .createNamedQuery(""Workspace.getTotalCount"", Long.class) .getSingleResult(); } catch (RuntimeException x) { throw new ServerException(x.getLocalizedMessage(), x); } finally { uow.end(); } } ``` I'm just not sure that even if  we waste some resources with Transactional it's a good idea to change an approach.  It can break something bigger than just a metric. Do you think it make sense to start digging in `UnitOfWork && JpaYYYDao` direction?::I think what @metlos is trying to say, that single `SELECT Count ...` is already atomic operation and does not need transaction handling on any level, because it's ensured by database itself. So basically just remove the `@Transactional` annotation from your current code. Am I right @metlos ?::>So basically just remove the @Transactional annotation from your current code - that is not going to work.

This PR provide a quick and minimal fix to unblock the failing update of workspaces from `CRW 2.0.0` to `CRW 2.1.0` To summarize : - We just log an error to the Che server when the workspace-specific OpenShift project cannot be marked as managed by Che - And **we do not prevent the workspace to start** anymore - The **only impact** is that when deleting the workspace, the related OpenShift project will not be deleted automatically. - But afaict it was already the case in 2.0.0. So I'm not sure this is even a regression - And this impact is very minor since the default for all new workspaces created after 2.1.0 update will be to use a common user-related OpenShift project.

Unlike the original PR (https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/16529/files) which uses static util class to convert Endpoint to ServerConfig and Service, this PR is taking in from a bit different perspective. It's enhancing `ServerConfigImpl` with static factory method `createFromEndpoint`. For second conversion `Component` -> `Service` there is new class `ComponentToKubernetesConverter`, which holds the `Component` instance and is providing single method `List<Service> toService()`. I like this one the most. Alternative version can be to have `ComponentToKubernetesConverter` as a bean, inject it and have `toService` method to accept the `Component`. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? <!-- #### Changelog --> <!-- The changelog will be pulled from the PR's title.

Unlike the original PR (https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/16529/files) which uses static util class to convert Endpoint to ServerConfig and Service, this PR is adding convert `Component` -> `ServerConfig`s into `ComponentImpl` model entity and for `Component` -> `Service` there is `KubernetesComponent` which is extending the `ComponentImpl` with this new functionality. These are then used in Appliers. What I don't like about this is making model entities too clever. They are only data objects now. Also to work with `KubernetesComponent` we need to create it from original `Component`, which feels weird to basically adding single method to the component in one phase of the devfile processing. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? <!-- #### Changelog --> <!-- The changelog will be pulled from the PR's title.

My assumption is that reason for https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/16512 is deleted but not garbage collected objects. In this PR https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/pull/1742 introduced changes in delete behavior. As you can see here https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/16512#issuecomment-609676415 Instead of ```{""apiVersion"":""v1"",""kind"":""DeleteOptions"",""orphanDependents"":false}``` it sends now  ```{""apiVersion"":""v1"",""kind"":""DeleteOptions"",""orphanDependents"":true}```. This issue was reported here  https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/1840. After studying this code - https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/blob/555c3790b02b910d62f72e95350dd563c97359a8/kubernetes-client/src/main/java/io/fabric8/kubernetes/client/dsl/base/OperationSupport.java#L221 - https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/c1f1b1bceb8e6dfbc0083617a25f17dd8d57340b/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1/types.go#L478-L494 I think that instead of trying to revert this behavior we should use new semantic with ```propagationPolicy= foreground ``` since we don't expect some leftovers after we call `delete` operation.

Use the `projectName` field.::`projectName` and `serviceAccountName` refer to the user namespace and the user serviceaccount.  The `che` ServiceAccount in the `che` namespace need to be able to manage resources in a user namespace.::yeah, here we need to provide a namespace where che-server is deployed. Not sure if the SA name is configurable though cc: @davidfestal ::I would probably move the logic of granting the rights on the level above to the `OpenShiftProjectFactory` / `getOrCreate` + extract the logic of the role / rb to a separate class smth like `OpenShiftStopWorkspaceRoleProvisioner`   with docs and tests::it looks like we need to create a `@Singleton` that would be bound in the `OpenShiftInfraModule` / `KubernetesInfraModule` and expose information about the namespace / sa. My observations are that `che` SA name is hardcoded and not configurable and namespace name can be obtained via `System.getenv` (Need to check if this will work in all the cases e.g.: - the operator uses `KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE` env var - helm `POD_NAMESPACE` ::the fix is not related to the original issue right?::the fix is not related to the original issue, right?::nice, IMO in future we need to standardize the env var name and always use `KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE` that is defined in the operator::Probably we can move the logic of obtaining the env vars to `@PostConstruct` to avoid reading env vars on every call::technically speaking `installationLocation` can be null based on implementation, so in this case can we log error and avoid doing anything in the provision method?::Would be nice to add docs with a description of why the provisioned is added and what problem does it solve::Adding docs would be also really nice to have::no, but it seems to fix https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/16534::good idea::@skabashnyuk FYI^::can you inject them as `env. KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE` in the constructor?::javadoc::is this env vars are set by k8s or che-operator?::CC @metlos ::javadoc? Would it be possible to create test for this class?::the problem is that helm & operator are using different env vars (POD_NAMESPACE - helm / KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE - operator)::it didn't help match in my case. @metlos can you try it from your side?::Confirmed to fix #16534.::Is it possible to change the helm chart to also call this `KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE` or does helm define this dynamically?::I'm also voting for this to be somehow injected in a constructor or at least having a no-arg ctor determining the value from the env vars and another ctor initializing the namespace from a provided argument. Also we should probably throw an exception if we're not able to determine the namespace.

Not a huge issue though.::Maybe a warn if both `podNamespace` and `kubernetesNamespace` are defined but not matching would also make sense? I don't know if this can occur naturally but might be a hard-to-debug issue.::I think it makes more sense to inject `OpenShiftCheInstallationLocation` but store `OpenShiftCheInstallationLocation.getInstallationLocationNamespace()` as a String in the class. It shouldn't change while Che is running, right?::good point, the problem is that we do need this PR in 7.12.0 and I'm not sure if @tomgeorge has time for further refactoring::in general, we do need to standardize the env var name (use only KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE) and remove usage of `POD_NAMESPACE` e.g. in helm chart https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/deploy/kubernetes/helm/che/templates/deployment.yaml#L38 But we should do it in a separate PRs I beleive after 7.12.0::Can we have test for this class?::I suggest using constructor injection. It would be much easier to test.::And ```javax.inject``` instead of google inject.::@skabashnyuk I believe we need to refactor this class based on the valid comments in the review e.g. move to different location + remove completely the usage of `env.POD_NAMESPACE`. wondering if this will be ok do in a separate PR though, since we really need to have a fix in 7.12.0::@skabashnyuk  unfortunately Guice does not support constructor injection with optional dependencies[1].  We need to have these dependencies be optional for now because each installation method uses a different environment variable to specify the installation location.  Perhaps when we refactor the installation methods to use the same environment variable, we can revisit this? 1. https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#how-can-i-inject-optional-parameters-into-a-constructor::what about import org.eclipse.che.commons.annotation.Nullable?::It didn't work, that was what I was asking about yesterday::I assume it's not working this way ```java @Inject public OpenShiftCheInstallationLocation( @Named(""env.KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE"") String kubernetesNamespace, @Named(""env.POD_NAMESPACE"") String podNamespace) { this.kubernetesNamespace = kubernetesNamespace; this.podNamespace = podNamespace; } ``` but should work ```java @Inject public OpenShiftCheInstallationLocation( @Nullable  @Named(""env.KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE"") String kubernetesNamespace, @Nullable  @Named(""env.POD_NAMESPACE"") String podNamespace) { this.kubernetesNamespace = kubernetesNamespace; this.podNamespace = podNamespace; } ``` No? ::https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/infrastructures/openshift/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/workspace/infrastructure/openshift/project/OpenShiftProjectFactory.java#L56-L61::No, neither one worked.  They both complained about not being able to find a binding for  `env.POD_NAMESPACE` when it was not defined in the container, even though it was defined as `@Nullable`::I think those work because they are defined in `che.properties`, either null or with a value.  `POD_NAMESPACE` and `KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE` are not defined in those files, and `@Nullable @Named(""env.POD_NAMESPACE"") String podNamespace` fails to create the injector because there is no implementation bound to it.::you right.

Handle it differently from other unrecoverable errors because this should be handled unconditionally. Additionally having ""Failed"" in the unrecoverable event list could produce false positives due to the way we handle event messages. Also make sure that we handle the situation where a pod is declared running but one of the containers is waiting and has terminated before. This actually can happen without us first receiving the event about it terminating, possibly due to timing issues (on the Kubernetes side?).

Currently oAuth requests are not allowed to use machine token, so this web app loads a keycloak token on start and opens the oauth authenticate popup with the help of the keycloak token. If we need to get the oauth provider's token the web app send a user token to the window which opened the app. Then the client that opened the app will receive a user token which can be used for other oAuth requests like `getToken()`. How to test: 1. Setup a github oauth client: https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app 1. Setup a github identity in the keycloak admin page. * Paste the client id and client secret from the gihub oauth app. * Paste the redirect url to the github oauth app. ![screenshot-keycloak-che 192 168 99 254 nip io-2020 03 30-15_16_25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7668752/77911517-97c42b80-7299-11ea-9b44-d3b259cf18e0.png) 2. open the web app by url ` <che-url>/_app/oauth.html?oauth_provider=github` ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? #15261 <!-- #### Changelog --> <!-- The changelog will be pulled from the PR's title.

Fixes the workspace count metrics that didn't count created and not-yet started workspaces. The cause of this issue is that when we create new workspace, we set it's status activity as STOPPED but `lastStopped` remains null. Then this query https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/wsmaster/che-core-api-workspace-activity/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/api/workspace/activity/WorkspaceActivity.java#L38 which is counting the workspaces in stopped state does not pass the second condition and these workspaces are not counted. :warning: This patch fixes the issue for newly created workspaces, because it fixes the creation process. The workspaces that are already created and never started will remain uncounted. Is that an issue? Alternative fix might be to update the query to `AND (a.lastStopped <= :time OR a.lastStopped == NULL)` Another alternative fix of grafana dashboard number would be to create new method, probably in `WorkspaceDao`, to provide simple workspace count. Currently we're doing 4 queries for each status and displaying sum of them on Grafana dashboard. Even if we decide do to it with new method, this patch is still valid IMO. WDYT? ### What issue does this PR fix https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/13226::Can we alter the table after that and make `last_stopped NOT NULL`?

This basically means that you can for example access other workspaces from the current workspace, create new workspaces, delete workspaces, etc... I would call that a security issue, because it is conceivable to imagine that a user might import an ""infected"" devfile that would contain some code that could read the machine token from the env and wreck havoc in all the user workspaces - reading secret data, delete stuff, DDoS the cluster with hundreds of workspace start requests, etc.::The `token` method is already opened. Actually I don't understand how oAuth API can influence the che API. It allows to get the GitHub or OpenShift token, but that was discussed earlier. cc @skabashnyuk ::To be fair, I misunderstood the purpose of the API :roll_eyes: But I still think this is a dangerous thing. If for example the user authenticated with OpenShift authenticator as himself and the workspace is able to get hold of the openshift token (which I think it would with this change?), then the workspace can also go to keycloak and use the openshift token to get access token for the Che API. From there we're at a place I described in the above comment. Maybe I'm wrong (I'm fairly new to this auth business to be fair) but giving the whole of workspace (which can come from various sources) is a dangerous thing.

That would cause an exception to be echoed along with a stacktrace. That's not necessarily the purpose of this logging message. This is for when an unrecoverable event happened and you want to log it in the place, so that you can see where it happened in the test output before you throw an actual exception::e.g.: ``` ... catch(error) { Logger.error(`SomeClass.someMethod Expected element disappeared unexpectedly. Cannot recover, ending test suite.`); throw new RuntimeException(`Expected element disappeared unexpectedly`, error); } ... ```::Sorry, I can't get your mind. Let me describe what I think. In a case, if something went really wrong you just have to interrupt execution by throwing an error message. Here you can see how it works: ``` suite('Login test', async () => { test('Login', async () => { throw new Error('Custom error message'); await driverHelper.navigateToUrl(TestConstants.TS_SELENIUM_BASE_URL); await loginPage.login(); }); }); ``` On the screenshot, you can see that an ""Error"" applies a custom message and also keep a stack trace. ![Screenshot from 2020-03-10 14-38-43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22724619/76313860-71385380-62de-11ea-8fc8-ca44ff13834e.png) ::![Screenshot_20200310_135708-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16451875/76314678-91b0df80-62d7-11ea-9657-ba9591f8303d.png) ::with the above example I know when, within which method the fatal message occured.

This PR makes the default single user deployment configure jwt proxy in such a way that it essentially acts as a passthrough proxy (excluding `/` from auth). Some code consolidation has been done to make this DRY. Additionally, the JWT proxy is made to honor the side car image pull policy setting and completely configures the JWT proxy pod so that we don't depend on the defaults hardcoded in the jwt proxy image. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? #15651 #16053::Please change java to doc to make it clearer that not the result is nullable.::Some docs are appreciated::Good to see that my classes are born without my participation::Maybe it makes sense to update https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/assembly/assembly-wsmaster-war/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/che/che.properties#L523 to make it clearer that requests will be proxied but without authentication check::rofl::how hard would it be to teach JWT proxy to act as a pass-through proxy without dummy key magic?::There is another kind of verifier ""key server"" that the key pair boils down to being required for - it is called ""keyregistry"" and requires just a URL, which we could provide with just some dummy value I believe. But we would have to do quite big changes to `JwtProxyConfigBuilder` on the che server side to support different kinds of key servers than just the currently used ""preshared"" (which is the thing requiring the preshared ssh key). So IMHO generating the dummy keypair is cheaper and safer than rewriting the config builder on the che server side. I do agree it would be more correct to enable other kinds of key servers for different verifiers in the config builder. But I think that can be safely done in a separate issue.

So this is an environment variable that should be set before test run? cc @ScrewTSW ::Does it make sense to change argument type to enum instead ""string""? I mean that in case with ""string"" it is not understandable what possible variants exist. Instead enum makes it more clear: ``` enum ExitConfirmation { NEVER = 'never' ... } public async setConfirmExit(askForConfirmation: ExitConfirmation) ``` Also, I think it will be also helpful for terminal type setting. What do you think about that?::It's not necessarily that I would prefer it. I honestly didn't try using the variable. This approach just worked for me and it was like a third thing that I tried, so I was satisfied ^^; We could try to test it by changing the env variable and if it works I will revert my commit.::**Note please:** In case with variable we have 2 benefits: 1) **The NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0** operates globally on node process and we do not need add  `new https.Agent({ rejectUnauthorized: false })` construction 2) With **NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0** all classes that use axios requests will be work correct.

The issue caused by `RecoverRuntimesTask ` that iterates over the list of workspace runtimes and trying to recover it without checking if they are already recovered. At the same time, multiple threads can recover runtime from `injectRuntime` methods. To mitigate this problem I've revorked RecoverRuntimesTask. It makes such a sequence of actions. 1. acquire write lock 2. check if runtime already restored by other threads. 3. If needed restore runtime. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/15801 <!-- #### Changelog --> <!-- The changelog will be pulled from the PR's title.

If so, I would rather handle writelock in `recoverone` method and make `getInternalRuntime` simpler with just readlock. I agree that this solution is simpler and safer one, but it's not the most readable and intuitive.:: I would personally leave the write lock in the (code path of) `getInternalRuntime()` as well just to be doubly sure we don't mess up when the runtimes are requested concurrently, say from the UI and some automation over REST API. I agree the naming is a bit confusing here though. ::>In getInternalRuntime, do we really need writelock for just getting the runtime? Or is it needed only for restore?? I assume Yes and No. We need readlock at the beginning and write lock if we need to recover runtime. Also will need some `double-check locking or so` to ensure a correct response. And all of that doesn't have a lot of sense because major lock implementation implements read lock as write lock. >If so, I would rather handle writelock in recoverone method and make getInternalRuntime simpler with just readlock.

I would actually do two changes here. 1) I would change this method to be more general (something like `setTerminalType(string/enum)` so we can switch back and forth if needed. This shouldn't be a big change. 2) I would also prefer separation to for example two methods - this one would be handling the requests (get/post) and second one would be handling the work with json (parsing&editing the json object)::For what we should strict the axios opportunities?

Could you please elaborate a bit more?::I don't see much difference in this specific case. I understand that the form you are suggesting could be very beneficial in some other cases.

And I see that it may be a problem in the future. For example if we will need test ""Che"" with external ```keycloak```. And this is only one example. In this case we will not be able to reconfigure ```RequestHandler``` for successful queries using inversify. And I suggest to lay this opportunity. Besides, it doesn't require a lot of changes, minutes on this stage may save hours or even days in the future.::I would suggest to prefer `If` without `else` where it's possible, because it shortens possible execution paths and so makes the code easier to read and understand.

Exactly, using my suggested way we will don't care about way to obtaining token, because we will be able to override it as we want, in one place, as simple as possible, without duplication.

This draft doesn't have any syntax errors (can be transpiled), but I haven't actually tried that... I'm almost 100% sure I forgot some `await` or something like that. I just wanted to ilustrate what I think is nice approach)::Heh... This conversation about ifs and elses is starting to be almost ""decadent"" :-D Nobody is questioning, that the approach you are suggesting here and all the resources you are linking here are talking about is the right approach in general and in most of the cases, but in **some specific cases** writing `else` statement could be ""neutral"" (nor good, nor bad) :-D Anyway... To close this pointless discussion... Isn't this `if` unecessary after all? Because `axios.post` has `data` as optional: ``` post<T = any>(url: string, data?: any, config?: AxiosRequestConfig): AxiosPromise<T>; ``` Thus we don't have to care about that at all, isn't that right? ::Of course, you are right, if axios can apply null data. But I am not 100% that axios handle null data in the way we expected. Should be verified I guess.::``` export interface ITokenHandler{ // Returns either empty object, or object containing Auth header. getAuthHeader(): Promise<any> } ``` Interface has name ""Token Handler"" but returns header.

Other than this... have you found something to disagree in a way how it's architectured? (there can be multiple improper names, forgotten asyncs in my changes...

I didn't... just because I don't find this necessary. Thinking about it now, I can think of only one reason to keep the mechanism of obtaining token separate - And that's if somebody would need to use the token without using `CheApiRequestHandler`... Is that why you separated this into own layer? If we have good (future) use case for this, let's go with this separation. If no, I would prefer to use ""simpler"" approach.::  We have several different places.  My variant gives us huge flexibility and the possibility to reuse all separated modules (for example ""Token"") in other places. Let's agree to stop discussing about placing all to the one place, at least this approach doesn't respect SOLID principles, and I don't see any reason for intentional misconduct these principles and reducing the quality of the code. I strongly disagree with your point that if the proposed solution resolves a specific problem we don't care about anything else. And for forwarding the best practices we need additional reasons. Just resolve a problem don't enough for me. We should think strategically. This solution should respect the code quality, clean code principles and don't reduce tests flexibility. ::ok. Let's go with your variant.

It's very hard to follow such long method doing so many things::Look again :) While the code is indeed very similar, one loop operates on pods and the other on deployments. The only code that could be extracted from the two loops is the `try` block in the `else` which could have been a method that we would pass the pod data created from either the pod or deployment. Since these are the only 2 occurrences of the logic and they're both in the same method very close together, I didn't consider it necessary to extract a method for the 4 lines of logic. ::It is private and doesn't use any instance variables.::The code coverage says it is tested :) I tried hard to write a transformation that would do it with one collect but in the end I decided this way would be better. One way to do this with 1 collect would be to wrap all entries in a custom object that would reimplement `equals/hashCode` based on the pod name and do `distinct` on the stream prior to collecting to list. So the cost of doing that would be to wrap all intermediate entries in objects part of which would then be thrown away and creating an intermediate set in the `distinct()` call.

Reduces number of tls secrets in Che installation process. Actually we may use the same certificate, but treat it differently depending on `self-signed` flag. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/15810 Should be merged together with https://github.com/che-incubator/chectl/pull/476::So originally, before we had placeholders in namespace names, this test was merely ""if the namespace is different than the default one"". With the introduction of placeholders, we changed the condition to ""if this is a static, precreated, namespace"". Reverting that condition as you suggest, would actually mean ""if this is either a precreated namespace using a placeholder (e.g. `<username>-che`) or a namespace we create (e.g. `<workspaceid>-che`)"". So I don't think this change is actually valid. At the same time I agree the test is insufficient :) We need to capture the ""precreatedness"" of the namespaces here and I am afraid we cannot capture that by merely detecting the placeholders in the name. Maybe just actually give up and introduce `global.namespacePrecreated`?::I wrote a lot of words and thought about the behavior we need here, but then just removed everything because I got to a conclusion that Che Server must be configured with TLS certs to propagate always if it's different than Che Server one... We introduce placeholders and some conditions in helm chart and they are valid for ServiceAccounts, Roles, and RoleBindings... But what is the reason not to propagate TLS *secret* for WorkspaceIngresses?... At this stage, I believe that they must be propagated always if workspaces are not deployed in the same namespace as Che is because only in that case workspaces are not able to reuse Che Server's one...

You're using result object inside for some reason, but resulting in exceptions on public API of util class. Why? I hate these validate methods throwing exceptions, because it leads to controlling flow with exceptions which is nasty. But at least make it simple. Why not throw these exceptions in `validateInternal`? which should be private.::It should not be util class.::This class is a utility class because it is used a) in a workspace attribute validator (and having multi-level validation just because of the namespaces is IMHO an utter overkill) and b) in methods that are outside of validator workflow and operate with information outside of validator's reach. There are 2 ways of using this utility class. Either you want to report on error in the name (e.g. in the validator workflow) or you want to just check that the name is valid (hence, the 2 public methods). The internal enum is used to efficiently implement these two usecases without duplicating logic. The `validateInternal` method is not private because it is used in tests that would otherwise rely on exception message wording which I think is very brittle.::The exception is used as a parameter to the log statement and therefore the log message will be followed by the exception stacktrace in the log output.

If nothing else then this method should be renamed to, say, `getPluginHandle` or maybe even better we'd need some more logic that would first diagnose what kind of `pluginId` we're dealing with and then switch the logic based on that fact. I.e. basically inline this method and handle the different kinds of `pluginId` at the former call sites.::This feels a little bit hacky. Why would the `pluginComponent`'s ID be a URL?

I can change it back.::It's not clear to me why `fqn` needs to be reassigned here.::It's strange to have to null-check reference twice, what about something like ```java component = new ComponentImpl(); component.setType(PLUGIN_COMPONENT_TYPE); if (!isNullOrEmpty(fqn.getId()) { component.setId(fqn.getId()); } else if (!isNullOrEmpty(fqn.getReference()) { component.setReference(fqn.getReference()); } else { throw new DevfileException(...) } ```::If component has a reference it cannot have an ID, I believe.::I think it's clearer to check `!isNullOrEmpty(fqn.getId())` since that is the default state. A plugin that is a url should not parse to a non-null ID. ::It's strange to use this constructor since it will create a `ComponentImpl` that looks like ```yaml components: - type: chePlugin id: <url to plugin meta.yaml> ``` Why not ```java ComponentImpl component = new ComponentImpl(); component.setType(PLUGIN_COMPONENT_TYPE); ``` additionally, if the null check on line 190 fails (`fqn.getId()` is `null`), then the component will be left with an ID that is a url, which is invalid.::I chose that constructor because that is what the previous version of the code used in the normal circumstance (plugin with an ID/reference).::so if the id is not null then make a normal component, otherwise make a reference-type component?

A Component created from a URL would have an `id` of null and a set `reference`.::Technically speaking, this code _should_ (as far as I understand) always have reference and id set, since `evaluateFqn` fetches the meta.yaml and throws an `InfrastructureException` if any id field is empty.

Because for now this method checks the behavior of notification center widget. But possible case that after clearing notification center, notifications may still be present.::Thank you, will change it to trace::I've ended up removing the method altogether as it's no longer required since I'm using the DialogWindow class now.::done.::Not relevant anymore, using DialogWindow methods now.::Done.::@Ohrimenko1988 ^::For me looks too congested. In my opinion if delete all ""Logger.trace"" occurrences the code will look much clearer, readable and understandable.::well, before you suggested to switch it to trace so that it doesn't pollute the debug. Traces are really valuable for me sometimes when I'm trying to figure out what went wrong. If you're ok with that, I would prefer to keep it there::I think may be replaced by: ``` await this.driverHelper.waitDisappearance(locator, timeout) ``` And locator should consist of notificationCenterContainerLocator + /{childTag} for me, it looks much simple than ``` for (var attempts: number = 0; attempts < (timeout / 1_000); attempts++) { if (await this.driverHelper.hasChildren(notificationCenterContainerLocator)) { Logger.trace(`Ide.closeAllNotifications notifications still present. Trying again in 1s.`); this.driverHelper.wait(1_000); } else { return; } } throw new error.TimeoutError(`Ide.closeAllNotifications there are still notifications present after closing. Timed out after ${timeout}ms`); ```::Could you explain a reason why you deleted this method::it's not easy to append a path to an already constructed locator. the string it generates looks like `By(xpath, <locator>)` It's better to have a separate one just for the notifications.::It makes absolutely no sense to close notifications after clicking the top menu item and it was stealing focus from the `Terminal` element causing the windows to close since the method `closeAllNotifications` is performing clicks. If you want to make sure there are no notifications present, you should call it in your tests separately before you call `TopMenu.clickOnTopMenuButton` I've discussed it with @Katka92 and @rhopp  and they agreed::replace ``` await dialogWindow.waitDialog(timeout, expectedDialogText); await dialogWindow.clickToButton(dialogWindowOpenLinkButtonText); await dialogWindow.waitDialogDissappearance(); ``` by ``` await dialogWindow.waitDialogAndOpenLink(timeout, expectedDialogText); ```::I can suggest other variant: ``` public async hasChildren(elementXpathLocator: String): Promise<boolean> { return await this.isVisible(By.xpath(`${elementXpathLocator}//*`)); } ``` For me looks much simplier::I would argue it makes the code even more understandable.::https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/tests/e2e/pageobjects/ide/DialogWindow.ts#L79 this and the method above it seem to be in an incorrect order::It doesn't make sense if notifications appear at the bottom left corner. as now But this method was put there when notifications appeared at the top center and override the top menu. Can you guarantee that it will not be there again for example tomorrow?::In my opinion it looks congested. I'll prefer to delete them::I've fixed the method: From: ``` await this.ide.waitApllicationIsReady(await this.getApplicationUrlFromDialog(dialogText), timeout); await this.clickToOpenLinkButton(); ``` To: ``` const applicationUrlFromDialog: string = await this.getApplicationUrlFromDialog(dialogText); await this.clickToOpenLinkButton(); await this.ide.waitApllicationIsReady(applicationUrlFromDialog, timeout); ``` This resolved the race condition::@ScrewTSW: `Logger.trace(""Ide.closeAllNotifications driverHelper click Notification Center icon."");` duplicates `Logger.debug('Ide.closeAllNotifications');` and so looks redundant in final code. It might help in development of tests, but make it harder to support by others. Actually, it's the propose of comments and proper naming of classes/variables/methods to make the code more understandable - logging command makes code execution more understandable, but the price is less understandable code which harder to read.::",21e12965f3e8aca38dbe57cb476358c76d567bfa::44e9f6cebd5ce8df1c1116bc4a3a948f7f8bfb66::

https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse/che,15713,propagateDefaultPersistVolumeBehaviour::master,0,closed,status/code-review::kind/task::,"### What does this PR do? 🚧 It's suspended in favor of https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/15775 In the scope of issue about configurable Dashboard https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/15462, the default value of ephemeral mode should be configurable as well. But Che Server already contains hard-coded behavior for persistVolumes (it's true), that can be overridden with the corresponding attribute on workspace level. It makes more sense to make Dashboard consume Che Server default instead of configuring a separate default for it. So, this PR makes Che Server propagating default ephemeral mode value. Open question: to avoid reconfiguring existing workspaces, Dashboard must set default value explicitly (even if the user does not click on the toggle at all) ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/15462::please use (or create if does not exist) constant for the property name::My understanding is that this property is used to *disable* PVCs on a Che server deployment; in, e.g. OpenShiftEnvironmentProvisioner, we have the check: ```java if (pvcEnabled) { volumesStrategy.provision(osEnv, identity); } ``` so it seems as though setting this property to `false` would disable all PVC provisioning.::Though that also raises the question of whether workspaces work *at all* without it set, since at bare minimum `/projects` needs to be shared between Theia and the main container.::Thanks for catching it! Now it seems to be that `che.infra.kubernetes.pvc.enabled` is not really usable property, maybe it makes sense to deprecate it in favor of new `che.workspace.persist_volumes.default`... Will take a look::React with :rocket: to vote for `che.workspace.persist_volumes` Or :heart: for `che.workspace.persist_volumes.default` Or leave your proposal here:::2nd_place_medal: And I would expect `true` and `false` exactly opposite meaning. Or do I miss something?::React with :rocket: to vote for `che.workspace.persist_volumes` Or :heart: for `che.workspace.persist_volumes.default` Or leave your proposal here::I'm not sure this is the logic we want to go with -- I'd propose - If `persistVolumes` is not present, assumed default value is true. - Only use ephemeral mode when `persistVolumes` is explicitly false. This avoids the need to set it explicitly in all devfiles, and avoids breaking existing workspaces by disconnecting them from existing PVCs. On the workspace creation side (e.g. in the dashboard), this would be handled by explicitly setting `persistVolumes: false` if necessary, and leaving it out of the devfile otherwise.::Put another way: if - `che.workspace.persist_volumes.default=false`, any workspaces created will additionally have `persistVolumes: false` in their devfiles upon creation. - `che.workspace.persist_volumes.default=true`, workspaces don't get an added `persistVolumes` field.::I wanted to give an ability for Che Admin to configure default behavior of persisting volumes... AFAIU you propose to keep the current Che Server logic where explicit value is used or volumes are persisted by default and only propagate default value to be consumed by clients like Dashboard. I agree that it's safer in the perspective of existing workspaces without explicit values, where users do not expect changing behavior. On another hand, Che Admin configured value won't be set to all workspaces by default, even new if workspaces are created with another client but not Dashboard - like chectl, or factory(if the value is not set explicitly in devfile). I'm OK with the proposed alternative way since it's a lighter way that does not change the current Che Server behavior and at the same time allows us to configure Dashboard behavior via Che Server configuration. ::",8b77f7faf4601c74b834f305678e1aded612635d::03e6439900ba4ef5efecdef4b89a8903ce148f67::e9f4951253237eb8f807aab1575b59204a66142b::

Enables to set `che.api.internal` that is used by in-container pods. This property will be passed to pods as the environment variable named `CHE_API_INTERNAL` in pods. Almost all users don't need to care about this because the default value is set. `che.api` is bound to the environment variable `CHE_API` and `CHE_API_EXTERNAL`. It is same as the current implementation. Note that `che.api.external` have not existed until now. And it won't provided in the future also. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? - An alternative of #13774 . - Will fix #15663 . ::Javadoc for this class should be updated (""URL of Che API"" is unclear if we're supporting both public endpoint and internal service).::I'm not convinced this class shouldn't still be deprecated, since having three providers with some interdependency is strange. Which of `CHE_API|CHE_API_INTERNAL|CHE_API_EXTERNAL` are currently used? IMO only one of `CHE_API` or `CHE_API_EXTERNAL` should be provisioned. Ideally I would like to see `CHE_API` (the external, publicly accessible URL) and `CHE_API_INTERNAL` used, with `CHE_API_EXTERNAL` removed.::Yes `CHE_API_EXTERNAL` is redundant. The reason I left it is that Che-Theia uses it now. https://github.com/eclipse/che-theia/blob/546916ad2fdd058a37f31f7bea6d324591c7ae20/extensions/eclipse-che-theia-terminal/src/node/workspace-service-impl.ts#L106 I have no objection to set the deprecation flag to `CHE_API_EXTERNAL` if we agreed.::@monaka I suppose in that case it's safer to leave all three for now and plan deprecation in a separate PR/issue.::",ff6d6634a42d0e28f36c8e7ec7c87d1efab90c09::2f3941548575f39351bfdb51d3f96f4e5ee1325e::

Await waits for the promise resolution -> making it `boolean` and then, the async will make this inline function to return `Promise<boolean>` once again...

https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse/che,15619,abstract_common_tests::master,0,merged,,"### What does this PR do? Extract common test methods and LS tests to separate files. This will ease writing new tests and ensure that all methods are using the same flow (e.g. the workspace is created the same way in every test). ::It looks like you use outdated version of tests, because we get rid of this switchin for a long time ago.::Good idea if you really have the same steps. +1::-1 For that. First of all as far as I remember this is described as a bad approach in the mocha documentation. It may lead to errors. Another point, I strongly disagree to mix everything in one place. I follow an approach that one class should be responsible for one thin. For example we already have ""runTask"" method in the ""TopMenu"" pageobject. ::So maybe this method should be removed then so no one will use that. I'll do that in a new commit in this PR. What method should I use instead?::Nothing, just open workspace and do all actions as a user.::This class is responsible for common test methods, something like common tests used in stack tests. So it makes sense to me to have all the ""test methods"" in one place. If there is a `runTask` in TopMenu, than we can remove it from here and use the one from TopMenu of course, I'll fix that in the next commit. Thank you for the hint. :+1: ::There is a big difference between common methods grouped by tests type (stacks tests), and common methods that aggregate different pageobjects and methods without grouping. On my opinion, at least, they should be separated to the 2 different classes (common ide, and common dashboard): - createAndOpenWorkspace (dashboard) - stopAndRemoveWorkspace (dshboard) - waitIdeAndProjectImported (ide) And next methods looks as overengineering for me: - runTaskAndCloseTerminal - openFileInAssociatedWorkspace - runTask ::Can you please send me docs you are talking about? I found just this https://mochajs.org/#dynamically-generating-tests and according to it, it seems that using parameters in the description is OK. Thank you::Ok, agree about parameters. Let's discuss the second topic. https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/15619#discussion_r366863846 ::On my opinion using ***"" ` ""*** looks more clear. ``` suite(`Create ${stack} workspace ${workspaceName}`, async () => { ```::`Cannot find module './utils/RequestType'.ts(2307)`::And the same thing with RequestHandler::it would be great to name variables the same names because it is a bit confusing. I mean ```LSTests``` and ```commonLSTests```. I vote for ```commonLsTests``` ::What about renaming ```LSTests``` to ```LsTests``` ? ::On my opinion ```waitWorkspaceReadiness``` method doesn't relate to ```ProjectsAndFileTests``` On my opinion it should be moved to the right place, or class should be renamed and reflect its content, or method should be deleted.::Besides ```waitWorkspaceReadiness``` name doesn't reflect a functionality of the method, Because in this method you wait workspace readiness, wait ide and wait until project imported. And in my opinion this method too general. Maybe better to split it into two parts? ::Maybe ```openFileAndSelectEditorTab``` ?::Minor improvement - you can use backticks (\`). This way you can use normal and double quotes inside the string as well as variables. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals::It is quite verbose I think.  If we would look at methods used on *.spec.ts as at BDD, then the person specifying this method would probably expect that if you open a file, its editor tab will be selected. So I would leave it as it is. ::If we'll look at the methods used in *.spec.ts as a BDD definition, the `waitWOrksapceReadiness` makes more sense to me, because the user just wants to wait until the workspace is ready. And he doesn't care about the way it is done - if the test is checking project. So maybe this method should be moved to `WorkspaceHandlingTests` class?::Heh... I've never thought about this, but I think you are right... I've tried to read something online about best practices of using abbreviations in camelCase and this stack overflow makes sense to me: https://stackoverflow.com/a/27172000/2182461 In short: yes. I think we should treat abbreviations as ""words"" -> thus writing them ""strictly"" camelCase -> `LsTests` (if it would have been a function, it would have been `lsTests`, which is not very pretty, but it's consistent.) ::On my opinion workspace readiness is a workspace starting and ide downloading. It doesn't include project importing or something else.::I agree if change ""selectTab"" to ""waitTabSelection"" in other case it looks like additional step which doesn't reflected in the method name and may lead to the some misunderstanding::I think this is a discussion about how much abstract we want the content of specfile to be. Right now, after reading your discussion I see two ways to proceed and I'm find with either of them: 1) Have more granularity - In this case I believe we should split the method to two methods -> First will be waiting for ""workspace/IDE readiness"" (meaning IDE is loaded and ""user"" can start interacting with it) and second will be waiting for project to be imported. 2) Have less granularity - agree, that workspace is ""ready"", when IDE is loaded **and** project is imported. This way we could implement this in one function/test and call it ""waitForWorkspaceReadiness"". I know we are hiding some functionality and to overcome that, we could properly document (in form of javadoc) the function (in `ProjectAndFileTests.ts`) I'm slightly leaning towards solution `2)`, but even `1)` is OK for me.::",8514e121fec1f4488102632d398ab227fa184aae::af04ae83df08627e87a7e19af31c3777b7b35f05::b2460c45af272fa065ea06baa6e9c965b0ad0810::f3d3ebc2a513e5bd077a006e8e60c7f7126648e6::1e3b4b93540d1327189adbfdb990e72f81c26b45::

If yes, this doesn't seem right to me, as there is no validation, that the update was succesfull. Maybe even more I think updating should have separate spec.ts file to more distinguish these two scenarios (install vs update). And this variable wouldn't be needed at all.::@dmytro-ndp I don't mind.. @rhopp Really this change needs to check and automate a private case updating CHE6 to CHE7 and downstream projects using operatorHub which is not supported automate update. So we should do defined actions on web-console OCP. Actually we have a flow: install an application using old operator,    remove subscription old operator and then installed new operator to an existing application. But I'm not sure that we need a separate E2E test for this, because it will fully duplicate the part of steps from already exist `InstallCheByOperatorHub.spec.ts`. If the `TS_SELENIUM_UPDATE_INSTALLED_APPLICATION=true` the `InstallCheByOperatorHub.spec.ts` performs only part steps needed to subscribe to a new operator and ends.

This PR fixes bug which happens when someone tries to re-open just stopped workspace. The workspace loader then fails to load the workspace because of `Unknown error has happened, try to reload page`. Workspace loader tries to establish websocket connection and when connection goes closed by timeout then the loader raises the error. Most likely it happens because of Che Theia frontend still running in the iframe and iframe reaches limit of pending HTTP request.

https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse/che,15435,editorEnv::master,0,merged,kind/enhancement::,"### What does this PR do? It introduces a new feature: propagating plugin/editor component environment variables. This is archived by the following architecture change: Now we propagate the whole Devfile along with WorkspaceConfig and InternalEnvironment and it makes it possible to access components configuration and apply it on plugin brokering phase. What can be done better maybe in scope of separate PRs: 1. Now `EditorComponentToWorkspaceConfigApplier`/`PluginComponentToWorkspaceConfigApplier` modifies components that was originally passed. It's needed to make it possible to match component (configured with reference) with ChePlugin provided by plugin broker. As an improvement, we can get rid of it but Plugin Broker should provide additional information where it downloaded ChePlugin configuration. More see https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/15435#discussion_r356049993 2. The whole Devfile is passed to WorkspaceConfig/InternalEnvironment and by the time being only Plugins/Editors components are used. As an alternative way we could propagate only used parts and there is no clear and easy way to do it smoothly.

Run every command and make sure that output has values provided with env vars. 3. Check workspace pod deployment (kubectl or K8s/OS Dashboard) and make sure that memoryLimit is right. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/14343 #### Release Notes N/A #### Docs PR https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs/pull/966:::rofl: ::What about updating the ChePlugin model to include a `source` field, where we could set either plugin ID or reference as a unique identifier in the plugin broker (I can implement this side if it helps). If the Che server is going to start downloading plugin metas it may as well do all the work in the broker.::To solve the issue with env vars propagating we could instead of putting here Devfile introduce two fields: `Component editor`, `List<Component> plugins`, and then use this as one storage instead of putting workspace config attributes + whole devfile.::Sounds OK for me at this stage, since devfile contains a lot of info which is unused here::it does not change a lot but makes a things a bit cleaner. Added the corresponding TODO::My thought was to update `ChePlugin` to have a field `source` that is just a string with either ```json source: <reference> ``` or ```json source: id   // or registryUrl/id if applicable ``` but I agree that this makes sense as a future consideration; it would be easier to implement after the brokers refactor is mergd.::> source: id   // or registryUrl/id if applicable I believe having single string value would make a component to che-plugin matching harder... Component has ``` id registryUrl //optional - default will be used if omitted reference ``` if plugin broker used default plugin registry - should it be included into source? if yes - Che Server then should do the same defaultPluginRegistry+id, or cut id from source and then compare it. But Che Server does not know for sure what is value of source field... not sure if I clearly share my concerns BTW it's good that we agreed that it could be improved as a future consideration. ::Maybe another solution to the problem solved by explicitly setting the id of editors and components would be if we stored  `Map<String, Component>` for editors and plugins (or maybe separately, not sure) where the key would be the resolved FQN.::I tried and failed. Editor/Plugin component now is in workspace module (not k8s specific). Moving editor/plugin configuration into environment would mean that we need make editor/plugin components do k8s/os infra specific and I'm not sure that it's a good think to do. We also would be able to introduce editor/plugins in workspace config level BUT now they are in workspace config attributes which are propagated like in many places, and it would mean that we should propagate editor/plugins as a separate arguments to all places where it's needed... And I'm not sure that we should invest time into such evolution. The more meaningful change would be to get rid of WorkspaceConfig at all, but it requires quite a lot of changes. It seems that putting while Devfile into WorkspaceConfig and InternalEnvironment is the quickest option. ::Hmm, I'm not sure on the best approach. I'll need to think about it more -- my initial idea was to have `source` match the attribute on the `WorkspaceConfig`, so that it could just be parsed, but maybe that complicates things. If adding the whole devfile into workspace config is a working solution, that may just be easier.::Maybe mention the involved plugin IDs (the chePlugin's and the ones from the devfile) for better debuggability?::Added such info into message and test case to make sure that it's well-formatted::",caa61871c5959d5d6bf113848dcb6ae82fc8d247::2b824713e6f11108881b6be4e5cf9d48658a838b::294cf4e60960b5fbc410652d0005dfb1ea80199d::

Or at least that's how I imagine it works :)::This is actually the exact thing that I wanted to ask @sparkoo about. I think this is OK given how preview URLs were set up previously, but I am not sure.::This is done because the attributes are present not only on a `ServerConfig` but also on other objects like `ServerDto`. IMHO having a single place that contains the logic for manipulating the attributes is a good thing. The fact that it is the static methods on a single interface is IMHO irrelevant. It could have been a static utility class, but interface is IMHO exactly that as well.::Yeah, that was my question to you. Does https ever happen in the current codebase and how?::Static methods on interfaces have IMHO been added to Java to exactly reduce the proliferation of utility classes.::I've done this in the newest version, only slightly differently. Your suggestion used the secured exposer even for non-secured external servers. I extracted the common logic into basically a free-standing function and reused it in both secured and non-secured exposers below the level of `KubernetesServerExposer` such that we don't assume how servers are exposed on that high level. Could you please re-review the latest version?::Good catch. A remnant of an older approach.::hmm, good question, but I don't remember. Does it work as expected? Isn't that handled later in different layer?::well, that's the thing - the current behavior is kinda undefined or rather quite implicit. We're only dealing with the situation where there is no matching endpoint for the service to be exposed. In the current master, there is an ingress created that just forwards traffic to the found service port but we don't back it with any machine, nor do we define a ServerConfig that this should be backed by. So basically we end up with a preview url that is defined on a command by path and port but that doesn't have any protocol. So here in this PR I basically added a more defined default behavior by specifying ""http"" as the default protocol for the preview url (or so I hope) and I am assuming that the top level path that is to be exposed is ""/"".::Why do we need a dedicated port for each exposableServerSet here? It's kind of surprise me that here we are in a loop of `onEachExposableServerSet` invoke `exposer.expose` that will do iterate on `onEachExposableServerSet` more more time https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/d46eb20398472a8e2a751002b1ae0ac85b5f56ef/infrastructures/kubernetes/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/workspace/infrastructure/kubernetes/server/external/ExternalServerExposer.java#L97 Did I miss something, if not - can we avoid it?::We need a dedicated port, because a server set needs to be exposed uniquely. So we need a unique route so that the user ""sees"" it as unique, but we also need a unique jwt service (and therefore a port), so that the backing service sees it as a request coming from a unique domain. Good catch of calling `onEachExposableServerSet` twice unnecessarily. Because of the changes to correctly handle the preview URL, the `exposeAsSingle` method is now public on the server exposer as well, so we can use that instead in the jwt server exposer.::> but we also need a unique jwt service (and therefore a port), so that the backing service sees it as a request coming from a unique domain.

https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse/che,15386,refactor-brokers::master,0,merged,kind/epic::status/code-review::kind/task::,"### What does this PR do? Rework plugin brokering process to accomodate changes in https://github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-broker/pull/80. Run metadata broker to get plugin tooling (similarly to how we're running the unified broker currently). Add the artifacts broker as an init container on the workspace pod to ensure extensions are downloaded. One benefit with this change is that we do not need to do anything differently when running in ephemeral mode. Since PR https://github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-broker/pull/80 is not yet merged, to test this PR you can reuse my built broker images: ``` CHE_WORKSPACE_PLUGIN__BROKER_METADATA_IMAGE=amisevsk/che-metadata-plugin-broker:dev CHE_WORKSPACE_PLUGIN__BROKER_ARTIFACTS_IMAGE=amisevsk/che-artifacts-plugin-broker:dev ``` ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/14494 #### Release Notes Improved plugin brokering process for faster workspace startup. #### Docs PR N/A ### Additional Info Depends on https://github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-broker/pull/80::Is it backward compatible? What if someone uses it? should we add aliases for this kind of change? ::This is in a section called ""Experimental properties"". So I would not sweat over breaking back compat here.::Do we want to care about the possibility of a name clash here? (I know this method already existed, but just want to point out the possibility).::Why a map of pods when we only ever assign a singleton map to it?::A migration step is necessary if a user is specifying their own plugin brokers, which is a good point and should be documented. What will currently happen is - Their custom brokers are ignored. - The upstream built brokers would be used. For users deploying with the default properties, no there aren't issues with moving versions.::It could potentially be a problem, but before it becomes one we'll have the problem of the same image being included twice in the pod, which would likely break the workspace anyways.::I did it this way in order to move the logic of ```java Map<> pods = singletonMap(pod.getMetadata().getName(), pod) ``` into the abstract factory and out of the implementations, since the environment builders take a map of pods. I'm indifferent to the implementation, though, I can move it back to `KubernetesBrokerEnvironmentFactory` and the OpenShift equivalent. This was probably caught in the crossfire of me trying to clean up the old `BrokersConfigs` vs `BrokerConfig` set up we had previously.::I think having 2 components with the same image can make sense for `dockerimage` components (e.g. starting them each with different entry point) but probably less so for plugins. So let's go with this as is now..::",8c27ba98d0dd84d73b6a35eab195206e3b77fed3::

This PR contains two separate commits which do: 1. Correctly catch errors that occur during transaction committing. 2. Process every activity record if an exception occurred during processing one. The fixed placed are covered with the corresponding tests. I found the described issue inspiring the following stack trace: ``` org.eclipse.che.api.core.ServerException: Internal Exception: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: insert or update on table ""che_workspace_activity"" violates foreign key constraint ""ws_activity_workspace_id"" Detail: Key (workspace_id)=(workspaceXXXX) is not present in table ""workspace"".

Some work still should be done to investigate how it's even possible that status is changing for removed workspace and what we can do to prevent appears such error. Probably it may happen when there is two active Che Server (Rolling Update) and it's an error from different Che instance than performs workspace deletion. It's just assumption and may be wrong. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/15248 <!-- #### Changelog --> <!-- The changelog will be pulled from the PR's title.

This PR allows to override values of the devfile using factory parameters, in cases when direct editing of the devfile is inaccessible. The value referencing rules are: - If the referenced value is a JSON object, the new value will be applied; - If the referenced value is not yet exists, the new value will be created; - If the currently referenced value is in a JSON array, the reference string MUST contain either `name` or `alias` of the referenced object; - If the currently referenced value is in a JSON array, but no object with referenced `name` or `alias` found, error will be thrown. Few examples: 1) Override metadata.generateName: http://<che.host>/f?url=https://..../devfile.yaml&**metadata.generateName=foo-** 2) Override project branch: http://<che.host>/f?url=https://..../devfile.yaml&**projects.p_name.source.branch=foo** 3) Override component memory: http://<che.host>/f?url=https://..../devfile.yaml&**components.c_alias.memoryLimit=500Mi** ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/13617 #### Docs PR ::can we use `keySet()` here?::what does it mean `stuff` ?::this `split` returns empty array only if you pass only in this case `""."".split(""\\."")`. Is it what you want to do? Is it valid key? Because it doesn't throw `InvalidDevfileException`. Can you please write test to it?::This is very complicated method. It took me a while to dig in to know what you're doing here. Could you please document it? I'm ok with inline comments, but current ones doesn't say much. Also please try to come up with better variable names. Consider splitting the method.::result what?::If I put `projects.test3` here, it it throws `NoSuchElementException`. Is it ok? Can you please write test for this case ?::first arg of assert is `expected`, second is `actual`. You have it reversed in all asserts I guess.::why but last one ?::is this cast safe?::is this cast safe?::nope. value is used.::stuff means different stuff :)::This is more like an protection for the next code line, which does `pathSegments.length - 1` so `ArrayIndexOutOfBound....`  is possible if length is < 1 (yes, should theortically never happen, but...). Do you think it's safe to remove this check at all? ::Order is OK, just imported wrong assert. Will fix.::Because it's impossible to change value of the current Json node,  to set value to Json node, you should be 1 level up and do `put(key, value)`.::Ok i will try to comment more::i'll put this into code comment::It's not safe to remove. You really get `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. However, now when you pass `.` as key, it doesn't do anything. If this is correct behavior you want, I'm ok with current code.::yes, seems we need extra check here.::In our case - yes since we're never get to the end value which can be TextNode or IntNode, we're always stay at least 1 level up.::In our case - yes since we're never get to the end value which can be TextNode or IntNode, we're always stay at least 1 level up.::Since `factoryParameters` is an input parameter, is it safe to mutate it this way? If it is safe, it should nevertheless be mentioned in the `FactoryParameterResolver#createFactory` javadoc.::Similar to the discussion on the `pathSegments.length`, I think we should do the sanity check on the lastSegment as well. Because path like `..` would lead to an empty `pathSegment` which I don't think is valid.::I haven't tested it but what happens if the last segment refers to child in an array?::Does this mean we cannot create new array elements?::`foo in an project name` -> `foo is a project name` And similar changed in the next line::Why are you creating an exact copy of the `pathSegments` here?::I believe it may be designed in a quite general style, so it could leave in its own Java class. Then DevfileManager and its test class would be simpler::Also, would it work if you just really iterated to the second last element using `Stream.of(pathSegments).limit(pathSegments.length - 1).iterator()` and then handled the last segment? Maybe it would simplify the logic in the loop where we would not have to check if we're at the last segment or not.::I have concerns if it's the right way to propagate every unknown query parameter as devfile override. It's kind of change the current behavior, now we just ignore such. Maybe we could solve this issue in the way how WorkspaceService#create. Then it could be look like the folowing: `factory?url=https://github.com/eclipse/che&override=projects.che.source.branch:featureBranch&override=projects.che.name:my-che`. From one point - url becomes a bit complicated comparing to the implemented way `factory?url=https://github.com/eclipse/che&projects.che.source.branch=featureBranch&projects.che.name=my-che` But from another view - overrides become more explicit, and I consider it as good stuff.::I'm not sure we need to do that. We have control over both the query parameter naming and devfile schema so we can ensure there are no clashes.::1) refactoring bug :) inititally it was doing copy with `length - 1`, BUT 2) `length-1` is not works when you have just one segment provided, you still need at least one iteration, thats why it is designed in `do-while` cycle.::Yes.

Support git operations for repositories with self-signed SSL certs #14527 #### How it works: For testing on my laptop I setup local git server which support cloning my https (e.g. https://gogs.io/) pretty easy for installation. #### minikube: After successfully deploy Eclipse on minikube need to execute next command: `kubectl create configmap che-git-self-signed-cert --from-file=ca.crt --from-literal=githost={host}:{port} -n=che` where: ``` ca.crt - your self-signed certificate {host}:{port} - host and port for HTTPS connection on your git server.  (optional if not set it given certificate will be used for all HTTPS repositories) ``` #### minishift: After deploy Eclipse Che on minishift 1. start `minishift dasfboard` 2. Go to the ""Resources -> Config Map"" 3. Create new Config Map: `ca.crt` : certificate content `githost` :  host and port for HTTPS connection on your git server (optional if not set it given certificate will be used for all HTTPS repositories). ![configmap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1636592/69053665-955fe400-0a12-11ea-850a-f297dd61356e.png) 4. Go to ""Applications -> Deployments - > Che"" and in Actions menu select ""Edit YAML"". In `containers` sections add configuration like this: ``` - name: CHE_GIT_SELF__SIGNED__CERT valueFrom: configMapKeyRef: key: ca.crt name: che-git-self-signed-cert optional: false - name: CHE_GIT_SELF__SIGNED__CERT__HOST valueFrom: configMapKeyRef: key: githost name: che-git-self-signed-cert optional: true ``` ![deployments](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1636592/69053691-a4df2d00-0a12-11ea-925b-dfe3d5807a6a.png) Now you can create and start new workspace. On each container of your workspace will be mount special volume that contains file with your self-signed certificate and to the `gitconfig` section with information about   git server host and path to the certificate. E.g. ``` [http ""https://10.33.177.118:3000""] sslCAInfo = /etc/che/git/cert/cert.pem ``` ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? #14527 <!-- #### Changelog --> <!-- The changelog will be pulled from the PR's title.

Support git clone for repos with self-signed SSL certs CHE-14527: Support git clone for repos with self-signed SSL certs #### How it works: For testing on my laptop I setup local git server which support cloning my https (e.g. https://gogs.io/) pretty easy for installation. After successfully deploy Eclipse on minikube need to execute next command: `kubectl create configmap che-git-self-signed-cert --from-file=ca.crt --from-literal=githost={host}:{port} -n=che` where: ``` ca.crt - your self-signed certificate {host}:{port} - host and port for HTTPS connection on your git server. ``` Now you can create and start new workspace. On each container of your workspace will be mount special volume that contains file with your self-signed certificate and to the `gitconfig` section with information about   git server host and path to the certificate. E.g. ``` [http ""https://10.33.177.118:3000""] sslCAInfo = /etc/che/git/cert/cert.pem ``` ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? #14527 <!-- #### Changelog --> <!-- The changelog will be pulled from the PR's title.

It then takes advantage of this new class and passes the selection of the namespace to the infrastructure API. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? #14908 ::Please add a few lines that would explain what is `runtime target`. For me, it's not obvious... I understand targetNamespace as namespace where workspace is run... And I assume that RuntimeTarget is something like who owns runtime, to whom this runtime belongs to...::Hopefully the the javadoc makes it clearer now.::Sorry, for me `RuntimeTarget` is not clear yet... Why `ownerId` is `RuntimeIdentity` and ownerName is part of `RuntimeTarget`?::javadoc would be useful::I would return boolean here, instead of throw checked exception. IMHO exception should handle exceptional state. The failed validation is not exceptional. We expect that if we call `validate`, it may not pass. Basically I would avoid checked exceptions everywhere. They're still in java probably only for backward compatible reason, but generally considered as a bad practice https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jdk-dev/2019-October/003461.html. Our codebase is full of them. It should go to technical debt issue, but for this task, I would avoid to adding more of them.::same with checked exception as method above::I would not expect this in `get` method. Javadoc is not helping with understanding this either.::wow the logic in this class is HUGE!  imho it's time to think how to split it.. maybe using strategy pattern (legacy vs new rules etc)::same as method below::the name of this method is confusing. I would expect it to get the namespace if it exists or create a new one and return if it does not. But it looks like it's doing something a bit different. Could you please at least document the method and maybe think of better name?::same as k8s::Would it be possible to fix workspace object as soon as possible in the chain, so we would avoid `if`s like this in the code later?::why this change?::can it be final ?::yes, I lold at this `boolean newLogic =`:: > IMHO exception should handle exceptional state. The failed validation is not exceptional. Agree and not =) If Java would be Go we would `isValid, message` Now we are able to go two ways: 1. Throw exception with a concrete message for a user. 2. Introduce some ValidationResult and two fields `isValid, message`. I believe from a user perspective of view it's much better to use `Hey, namespace attribute is longer than 63 characters` or `Hey, you're not permitted to use any namespace, only allowed - `sleshche-che`` instead of `Something is wrong with your workspace/attributes` Would you go with 2nd approach? I'm not sure that with current architecture, it would brings a lot of profit, ValidationResult should be transformed to Exception maybe on another level like WorkspaceManager, WorkspaceService. I'm not sure that we should invest time to rework like `createWorkspace` to one that returns ValidationResult... Hope I described my opinion pretty clear - if no - feel free to ask details.::I believe it may be reverted after the last refactoring in this area. Will do::I believe so, will do::yes, I've realized the same after I've submitted the review. 100% for result object. And yes, it might be transformed into the exception where appropriate. Preferably unchecked exception that will be catched where it is appropriate.::This is the soonest we can do it in a normal flow. We could theoretically do this during workspace recovery, but that would be a much larger change, because workspace recovery currently only reconciles running workspaces.::The thing is that this will return a namespace and it will also create it if configured to do so. So it will get it or create and get it.::why do you think the name is confusing? We are in a namespace factory and we are getting a namespace for given target.::Yes, this whole class is a mess. The naming was much more confusing before I tried to make it at least a little bit more approachable - `create()` would only instantiate an object that is able to access a namespace as just one example. We used the `EnvironmentContext` to get the current user on codepaths that don't originate in the REST API, etc. I agree we should think about splitting this class. Just not sure we should do it at the same time as changing the logic. I didn't find `newLogic` too funny when I had to write it to handle back compat ;) Strategy pattern would be good, but that would probably require quite a lot of change. The split between old and new logic is based on existence of a namespace - we cannot detect that in the constructor. Also the split is needed in a couple of methods that are hooked to a much larger workflow way beyond this class. I guess we have different thresholds for code ugliness, but I still find it better to try and make more sense of this class as it is in the broader picture than try to rearchitect the workspace provisioning.::A `get` method gives you access to a namespace of the workspace. Note that before, this method was called `create` :wink: ::It isn't.

Instantiating an object each time even in a hopefully much more common happy case IMHO outweighs the positives. Java has exceptions for rich handling of exceptional cases.

I'm able to reproduce this issue locally if my laptop is quite loaded with another process like maven build. And as we can see the first test takes the most time. ![Screenshot_20191030_155103](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5887312/67863731-1cfdb580-fb2d-11e9-8cc3-1229cd65cc6c.png) I did not find any information about why it may happen but I assume that it's related to memory allocation. I wrote a simple test that does nothing except N Objects ``` private static final int N = 10_000_000; @Test(invocationCount = 40) public void doNothing() throws Exception { List<Object> list = new ArrayList<>(); for(int i = 0; i< N; i++) { list.add(new Object()); } } ``` and it's what I get: 1. N = 10_000 ![Screenshot_20191030_154016](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5887312/67862910-9e544880-fb2b-11e9-8396-f67b936ebcac.png) I assume that it's a situation similar to what we have in ServersCheckerTest.java, when not much memory is needed and the first test always takes the most time. I assume that the process during the first test allocates some amount of memory and further tests just reuse it. 2. N = 10_000_000 ![Screenshot_20191030_153926](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5887312/67862970-b88e2680-fb2b-11e9-9bef-be7b2a4002f4.png) I don't have a clear explanation of why 2nd and 3rd take the most time but it's not really needed. My testing is not accurate at all and its purpose was just to show that using timeout needs additional care since invocation time may take different time depending on which it will be run(1,2,3,...), which time(a system is loaded, a garbage collector is active). I believe 5 seconds should be even more than enough for tests to be stable. In the pessimistic scenario (when there is an error in code or tests) we may pay 7*5=35 seconds of build time, but such a situation must happen only feature branch, where code is broken but not in master. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference?

It covers ""frontend"" part described in https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/14908#issuecomment-544487527 It allows specifying k8s namespace where workspace should be run with query parameter on workspace creating. It validates the specified name according to k8s namespace format and also it checks if the specified value is permitted on the Che installation: 1. If user.defined is true - then user can try to use any value, if he is not permitted to the specified namespace - workspace will fail to start during start. 2. If user.defined is false - then user is not able to specify any value except default one configured by admin. Notes: 1. The implementation has circular dependencies issue and it's why `KubernetesNamespaceFactory` use `Provider<KubernetesNamespaceFactory>`. Maybe there is a way to avoid such a trick, but I did not invent some easy to good looking ones. Maybe we should inline `checkIfNamespaceIsAllowed` method into `KubernetesWorkspaceAttributesValidator` but it would mean that we spread namespace related code around k8s infra instead of keeping it in one component. TODO: It's needed to forbid updating the namespace workspace attribute. ### Alternative way of implementing As an alternative way, instead of putting `infrastructureNamespace` key into workspace attribute, we could store it into `Devfile.metadata.namespace`, and then infrastructure would provide an implementation for validator of `Devfile`. We could implement it later as well. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/14908 #### Release Notes N/A #### Docs PR It should be provided along with another part of the changes when this feature will be fully working.::",516f3606336f928a502de39bc71a717b5a4bc840::4fa4036ca4fe3b027247f7bdf5243a5483746319::8c74d21ee24e80212f9f4a8a5798f8689cfe72f4::

This changes proposal changes default behavior of storing ssh private keys in Kubernetes secrets. There was a mechanism, that stored each private key in dedicated secret, that might faced with exception related to secret count limit in internal infrastructure. New behavior puts all ssh private keys in one Kubernetes secret in following structure: `host_name:private_key`. Location of private ssh keys was changes on file system and become: `/etc/ssh/private/{private_key_with_host_name}`. Kubernetes secret type was changed from `kubernetes.io/ssh-auth` to `opaque` to allow multi value secret. Here is example of secret stored in Kubernetes [1] and file system structure [2].

https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse/che,14828,bug/14795-use-new-props-for-wrkspc-namespace::master,0,merged,kind/task::,"### What does this PR do? This PR implements a quick and dirty way of implementing the namespace resolution according to the following rules specified in https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/14376#issuecomment-535511742. This is a very minimal implementation that is (hopefully) going to change drastically in the near future once we add the ability for the user to actually select the namespace for a workspace. Because the implementation tries to be very localized and minimal if mightily hacky, it deviates from the proposed solution in some minor details. Namely: * the name of the namespace is only stored in the workspace attributes on workspace start. The selection is NOT done during workspace creation. This is because to be able to do that we would have to build a whole new abstraction above the namespaces to make them infrastructure agnostic so that the workspacemanager can make the assignment. * The whole thing falls down if `allow_user_defined` is true, because we actually don't support that functionality yet. There's a warning emitted at start up time about that. * **MOST IMPORTANTLY** - as long as the namespace specified using the legacy `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace` or `che.infra.openshift.project` properties exists, the new property `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.default` is completely ignored and even the new workspaces are deployed into the namespace/project specified by the legacy properties. This is the consequence of the minimal amount of change we wanted in this PR and this restriction will only be lifted once we implement user-defined target namespace of workspaces. At the same time, we think that introducing this kind of change at this point in time will enable smoother upgrade as we progress with the 7.x releases and people start to adopt Che 7. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/14376 ::Please consider changing java doc as well.::It never is null. OpenShift returns forbidden if project does not exist. ![Screenshot_20191010_115105](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5887312/66553694-4346bb80-eb54-11e9-9b33-daa7d73cf629.png) ::See https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/14541/files#diff-fd303707b626771b58ee33d25ddc3afaR136::In your case checking 403 - is enough, since if the project exists but not available for user - it means that he is not able to run workspace there. In my case it would be better to investigate how OpenShift console handles it, if I'm not mistaken it distinct (during new project creation) when project does not exist and not available. ::Thanks! Fixed.::Please add this description for this placefolder into docs of `default_namespace` property in che.properties.::What will happen if default_namespace contains `<workspace-id>` placeholder? Will user receive default namespace with `null` as string?::It's a good time to mention in docs that `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace` and `che.infra.openshift.project` MUST NOT be updated anymore. And `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.default` must be propagated to deployments - like helm chart has `chenamespaces` parameter (I'm OK with handling this as a separate issue, we just should track it). And maybe the corresponding attribute should be propagated to Che-operator. Currently, target namespace depends on OpenShift Oauth https://github.com/eclipse/che-operator/blob/master/pkg/deploy/che_configmap.go#L89 With these changes it becomes always `<username>-che`. It's pretty OK with OpenShift oAuth but not sure that it even possible with Che Server service account.::Seems this PR also fixes https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/14585::No, the placeholder will not be replaced. `evalPlaceholders` only replaces the tokens if the the context contains a corresponding non-null value.

The message says that `Cannot determine whether a new namespace should be created` but seems it's already created just before invoking `isCreatingNamespace` method: ```java public KubernetesNamespace create(String workspaceId) throws InfrastructureException { KubernetesNamespace namespace = doCreateNamespace(workspaceId, namespaceName); namespace.prepare(); if (isCreatingNamespace(workspaceId) && !isNullOrEmpty(serviceAccountName)) { ``` ```java void prepare() throws InfrastructureException { KubernetesClient client = clientFactory.create(workspaceId); if (get(name, client) == null) { create(name, client); } } ``` Maybe some refactoring can make thinkgs simpler. I'll try to propose something.::```suggestion if (!isNullOrEmpty(getServiceAccountName() && isCreatingNamespace(workspaceId))) { ``` `isCreatingNamespace` method has quite heavy logic but in fact you don't need to evaluate it if serviceAccountName is null or empty. Since workspace SA is rarely empty or null it's minor but still optimization::Consider appending errror message as well.::it will return false even if namespace exists but not available because of RBAC settings. I checked and it should be OK in place where it's called but it makes me think maybe it's better to rename it to `checkNamespaceAvailability`?::Can't we reuse `isManagingNamespace` method here? For me, their purposes seem similar::No. Because we (are attempting to) create `<username>` namespaces but we're not deleting them, unlike for `<workspaceid>` namespaces, which we manage fully.::Hence the order of the checks in this condition. The `isCreatingNamespace` is not called if there is no service account configured.::I'd argue that is not a great name either, because it could be understood that a non-existent namespace is also available, because it can/will be created. What is the actual difference between a namespace that doesn't exist and a namespace that the server cannot see due to RBAC? If the namespace exists but the user can't access it, we're failing either sooner or later.::I propose to refactor this method in the following way ```java protected boolean isCreatingNamespace(String workspaceId) throws InfrastructureException { boolean legacyExists = checkNamespaceExists( resolveLegacyNamespaceName(EnvironmentContext.getCurrent().getSubject(), workspaceId)); // legacy namespace exists and should be used if (legacyExists) { // if it contains any placeholder("""" is <workspaceid>) - it indicates that Che created namespace by itself return isNullOrEmpty(legacyNamespaceName) || hasPlaceholders(legacyNamespaceName); } if (isNullOrEmpty(defaultNamespaceName)) { throw new InfrastructureException( ""Cannot determine whether a new namespace and service account should be"" + "" created for workspace %s. There is no pre-existing workspace namespace to be found using the legacy"" + "" `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace` property yet the `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.default` property"" + "" is undefined.""); } return hasPlaceholders(defaultNamespaceName); } ```::We can imagine some method like ``` if (checkNamespaceExists(namespaceName)) { project.delete(); } ``` and in case of RBAC permissions issue it would be better to have something like ``` if (checkNamespaceExists(namespaceName)) { project.delete(); } else { throw new InfrastructureException(""the current user is not permitted to remove namespace""); } ``` > I'd argue that is not a great name either, because it could be understood that a non-existent namespace is also available, because it can/will be created. Java docs can explain that `available` - exists and user is permitted to use it. Or another word can be chosen.::I don't agree with this. My implementation was meant to be as minimal as possible, injecting only a minimal amount of change needed to support the new properties. During the course of what we originally perceived as a relatively simple hack we uncovered other warts like the `isPredefined()` which I've split apart based on the different circumstances it was being used in. Which in turn uncovered this illogical implementation that was there from the very beginning. I'm not saying we shouldn't be fixing this, but let's do that outside of this issue. Let's implement the minimal thing here and leave the fixing and proper implementation of this mess to another issue. ::Indeed. Thanks for spotting this!::That is indeed much nicer to look at. Thanks!::``` if (checkNamespaceExists(namespaceName)) { project.delete(); } else { throw new InfrastructureException(""the current user is not permitted to remove namespace""); } ``` You get very similar behavior from just attempting the delete, don't you?::After all, the very next issue I already started working on - #14908 - is going to shake this up considerably.::we use || and it means that is newLogic is true - then it does not matter if namespace exists or not. It makes me thinking that something is wrong. Please double check that it's correct::Seems we can override it in the following way: ```java public boolean isManagingNamespace(String workspaceId) throws InfrastructureException { // the new logic is quite simple. boolean isNewNamespaceManaged = defaultNamespaceName != null && defaultNamespaceName.contains(WORKSPACEID_PLACEHOLDER); if (isNewNamespaceManaged) { return true; } boolean legacyHasWorkspacePlaceholder = isNullOrEmpty(legacyNamespaceName) || legacyNamespaceName.contains(WORKSPACEID_PLACEHOLDER); return legacyHasWorkspacePlaceholder && checkNamespaceExists(resolveLegacyNamespaceName(EnvironmentContext.getCurrent().getSubject(), workspaceId)); } ``` Not sure if it's simpler for understanding but at least conditions seem clearer.::",7ed6b189a0a8dca9a8af0075df185ea1c37f6e25::87764391ae5d08dc34128a5368939fb72a0e5429::bb586f670831ffaaf928542349d5e70227974695::12c3fcfbe7498b02a91faf3a631c77882002d858::c6e29c100699b384b048704666aba735d484dab7::a240d74a33fb1d92c18cb9914e0e8aaedfaae1f7::a19ebb8355f5124e61f359add558eea6cbe43e47::8e242a5bb1ef6bca9c24dea93212800f91e0bcad::17ba3e4ff58745f412f9faf0a28a33cf15014320::e30bfa55287603a34127fce97a27b2f6952040fb::54493899f2c4dcbdb5b8a6f4232db48e7fc845fa::4627ea946328fcaaf96f5f3d4c99c40ce7584c98::0fbc552f8742e980e1d528bb757a7a260d78560b::6c233425b46bdaf495bebfb97564761d3825e192::8b4e40f936f24ee4458f10ca48b3df32db8c211b::2b16123a0ca75b823d775e4c60c1b4486a748074::dd3c4acdacfed2889b7ed9b4ec6caf3c89926981::f47c40fd4ea3671fce4acdf992dd62da6431ed95::d5de2e6c4acc674751d09c217f6528c0adce1530::ff782f87f4f1d3dfd8d9998274a92e07502b0d7f::dda099326e0f70e35f85a9d884c332d0f8b60517::b936f187bc864f0d1e4fe71ce94171aa1b91e32c::26bacf80be6782b7f23140d90449914bb7890ab1::1663ab5a8bc55ce1696d6063d2c7e3293a32f4f7::5d530b17ad17139b33b6725ab0c61018fb71ea95::639e98940b628661cbd0efb0107992f2eff9a8d3::1bcfc511fb535c65c064412c18efb7f108a5e79f::

Fixes provisioning of volumes for ephemeral workspaces (https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/14749). It also brings the `EphemeralWorkspaceAdapter` more in line with `UniqueWorkspacePVCProvisioner`, which I think is an overall good change. ### Background PR https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/14539 modified the way that certain volumes are stored in the environment: it removed adding plugin volumes to the plugin's corresponding machine and instead placed them in the pod's container directly in order to support ephemeral mode volumes for workspace plugins. This means that the `plugins` volume added for every sidecar is no longer in the machine and instead attached to each container. The `EphemeralWorkspaceAdapter` was working off a previous assumption -- that all workspace volumes could be found in the list of machines in the environment -- and used that fact to reconcile workspace volumes (for each volume in machine, update the corresponding pod to use emptyDir). This meant that the `plugins` volume was not being provisioned at all (and thus had no subpath assigned). This PR changes `EphemeralWorkspaceAdapter` to be more in line with `UniqueWorkspacePVCProvisioner`, basically doing the same thing and then converting all PVCs to EmptyDir volumes. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/14749::",6a20658bd7cc6d14b24e6b45c2363c4a7c5500c2::44ef65fd9e6c8822fb0fd7e7648ec5f8a357d8d7::

https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse/che,14727,observability::master,1,merged,kind/task::,"### What does this PR do? Add monitoring & Tracing capability for multiple Thread pools of Che Server. ## ExecutorServiceWrapper One of the trickiest thing that was preventing us to add this monitoring earlier was a - Fact that monitoring and tracing can be enabled/disabled separately. - Quite a lot of classes constructing ExecutorService in the constructor that is hard to override. - To be able to handle the timing of the submitted task executor has to be wrapped, it's not enough to have just a reference. - The sequence of wrapping is important.  For example, if we wrap with tracing first we may lose the notion that ExecitorService was actually ThreadPoolExecutor. To help to handle this kind of situation I've added such interface ```java public interface ExecutorServiceWrapper { ExecutorService wrap(ExecutorService executor, String name, String... tags); ScheduledExecutorService wrap(ScheduledExecutorService executor, String name, String... tags); CronExecutorService wrap(CronExecutorService executor, String name, String... tags); } ``` implementation of this class has to be injected in all classes where ExecutorService is used to wrap the instance of executor. ## Minor enhancement. - JsonRPC. Reduced the number of classes used to configure JSONRpc endpoint. - ExecutorServiceBuilder - helper class to build new ExecutorService - CountedRejectedExecutionHandler - class that helps to count task execution rejections - CountedThreadFactory - the class that helps to count thread creating/running/termination - Grafana dashboard with traces grouped by execution level. Traces that happen on the same level grouped on the same panels ## Grafana To help to consume values from monitored executor services I've added some changes on Grafana dashboards. ### Executors <img width=""1609"" alt=""Знімок екрана  о 13 33 03"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1614429/67201860-8f70e600-f407-11e9-9e8a-33016a8173c6.png""> - Threads running - the number of threads that are not terminated aka alive.

I mean that openshfit component is not able to contains endpoints, so it won't produce server and such previewURL can not be evaluated. So: 1. Let's avoid non-working examples even in test sources, it would be better to use dockerimage component. 2. Maybe we should implement some validation... The difficulty that I see here - referenced plugins/editor configuration should be downloaded for validations since they can contain endpoints.::Add a new line please.::The corresponding warning should be propagated to k8s context instead of printing a logs.::To be seems this method must be rewritten to make logic clearer. Let me know if you would like to get some suggestions.::Like you can consider reusing KubernetesServerResolver to resolve server url by port.::yes::current implementation will create service+ingress in case it won't find ones with port::done::reworked::resolved. thanks for help with this::A theoretical question, but are we sure this is UI agnostic?::We're representing a `null` input with ""empty"" instance. While that might be technically OK for DTOs, it makes me wonder whether we correctly distinguish between the two when constructing the servers? Like is it possible that the provisioning will create a service and ingress with `null` path on port `0`?::So it is not possible to remove a preview URL from a command?::Do you mean for different editors than Che-Theia? I guess it is variable that just Theia will understand... How much only theoretical this question is?::`null` path is valid. And port `0` is technically also valid. So as it probably does not make much sense, it is possible. There is currently only check for `null` when constructing servers.::hmm, it is not. it should be ``` ... } else { this.previewUrl = null; } ``` I'll fix that::Is it still full URL or url with some placeholders like `${server.my-app}`?::I wonder if we can avoid need matching command to the machine in such case. In command, there is a defined port and since we run one pod - it should be enough for us to expose it. I suppose such implementation may be more difficult. Let me try to compare two approaches on examples: ```yaml components: - type: kubernetes alias: myJsApp referenceContent: | - kind: Pod ... spec: containers: - name: js-app ... - name: mongo commands: - name: run app previewUrl: port: 4200 actions: - type: exec command: nodejs server :4200 # it's just example ``` With the current approach, preview URL won't work since the component has two machines `db` and `web-app`. But Che Server could define a new Service/Route/Ingress without even knowing in which container user is executing the command. Let me know if it's not clear/detailed enough and some more info needed.::done::now it is again :)::the full URL is now constructed on the server and ingress/route is found by service and port. It's now working for your example. However, issue https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/14803 is back by this...::should we mention that query parameters can also be used here?::why do we need ``` ""additionalProperties"": false,```?::yes definitely. I have to retest query params!::Good catch. Without that, we accept devfile `1.0.0` with `previewUrl` (or any extra property). This prevents it and enforce to have `1.0.1-beta` when `previewUrl` defined. I'm not sure if it is a good idea and we do not need that for general preview url functionality. It just makes validation more strict.::it seems to be empty, --  maybe align filename meeded ?::filename changed to `devfile_command_with_empty_preview_url.yaml`::query params were not working. I've fixed them and updated this javadoc. Thanks, good catch.::Personally I prefer to reduce nesting levels, so Please consider the following change ```java for (CommandImpl command : env.getCommands() .stream() .filter(c -> c.getPreviewUrl() != null) .collect(Collectors.toList())) { Optional<Service> foundService = Services.findServiceWithPort( namespace.services().get(), command.getPreviewUrl().getPort()); if (!foundService.isPresent()) { LOG.warn( ""unable to find service for port [{}] for command [{}]"", command.getPreviewUrl().getPort(), command.getName()); return; } Optional<String> foundHost = findHostForServicePort( namespace, foundService.get(), command.getPreviewUrl().getPort()); if (foundHost.isPresent()) { command.getAttributes().put(PREVIEW_URL_ATTRIBUTE, foundHost.get()) } else { LOG.warn( ""unable to find ingress for service [{}] and port [{}]"", foundService.get(), command.getPreviewUrl().getPort()); } } ``` but it's question of taste.

We used to use a provisioner for preparing the environment before the start, and in such a case phase where it should be run is different. Also, we have two provisioners for previewURL, it make me thinking about something like: 1. `PreviewUrlEndpointProvisioner`: provision service and ingress/route for preview URL. It does pretty the same as ServerExposer does but for endpoints. Maybe then rename it to `PreviewUrlExposer`? 2. `PreviewUrlCommandProvisioner`: it's similar to `ServerResolver` as well. If we take a look into `ServerExposer` `ServerResolver` interaction, we can see that `ServerExposer` provision needed Services,Ingresses along with some metadata about servers, and then `ServerResolver` grab this meta info and use, it allows to avoid double matching user-defined servers to services/ingress. Maybe we could do something similar, `PreviewUrlEndpointProvisioner` provision annotation `org.eclipse.che.preview/run` - where run is a command name. Then PreviewUrlResolver once grabs all ingresses/routes and provisions preview into needed command. P.S. The only difficulty I see here - command name format, it should be compatible with annotation format ( we can not afford it) or I assume you can reuse the same algorithm you use for links names... WDYT?::You fetch the same services list for each command with previewURL, since it's K8s API call via http we could fetch it once and reuse. The same about Ingresses list https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/14713/files#diff-25437c9721ce7375785a2f31969cef82R102.::Maybe it's better to provision warning into an environment to make it visible for user?::Can you point where you provision this created port into service?::done::done::done::done::done::1. done 2. I would need a bit more explanation. It should be annotation in what kind of object? What to store there?

Changing 'che.workspace.pool.type' from 'fixed' to 'cached' by default. This change will use CachedThreadPool: > Creates a thread pool that creates new threads as needed, but will reuse previously constructed threads when they are available. These pools will typically improve the performance of programs that execute many short-lived asynchronous tasks. Calls to execute will reuse previously constructed threads if available. If no existing thread is available, a new thread will be created and added to the pool. Threads that have not been used for sixty seconds are terminated and removed from the cache. Thus, a pool that remains idle for long enough will not consume any resources. Note that pools with similar properties but different details (for example, timeout parameters) may be created using ThreadPoolExecutor constructors Originally implemented for `5.1.0` in https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/3701 the value has not been changed ever after.

Changing 'che.workspace.pool.type' from 'fixed' to 'cached' by default #### Release Notes Changing 'che.workspace.pool.type' from 'fixed' to 'cached' by default ::Previously, we had cached thread pool for JSON RPC messages and if I'm not mistaken it caused OutOfMemory crashing... If we set cached without any limit - I assume it can lead to OutOfMemory crashing as well. With JSON RPC it was easier to reproduce, but still... Maybe it makes sense to consider this value to be configured along with the memory that Che container gets. Like in `che.properties` it's fixed and every deployment provides his own values according to provided container memory. To be more safe we could instead of reusing default java cached pool, introduce our own cached pool with a maximum size. We could estimate some maximum size according to container memory. I'm not a big expert in this area, and it's just thoughts. In reality, my comments may be not so critical or not relevant at all.::yeah, this sounds relevant - having no ability of spesifying `maximum size` is potentially risky. but again, according to the docs: > Threads that have not been used for sixty seconds are terminated and removed from the cache. Thus, a pool that remains idle for long enough will not consume any resources So, it looks like technically we should not care about  `maximum size` (if we should than there is an issue on the other level e.g. RAM misconfig etc)::",e4d4542fa77d61a7e7b6f0b7e77dcdd03b28c0b7::

The kubernetes runtime definitely does do DB calls. Maybe not directly in the infrastructure but the classes it depends on, do access the DB.::After discussion, we'll not use this implementation.::We'll not use this implementation.::I think you should not invoke this method...

https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse/che,14541,k8sNamespaces::master,0,merged,kind/task::,"### What does this PR do? It does not change the current workspace creating flow, but used namespace still managed by `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace`. See more how workspace creation flow will be changed https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/14376#issuecomment-535511742. And this PR introduces API that will be used by clients to provide an ability for users to see target namespace info, and choose one if multiple are available. So, there are two configuration properties that are used for configuring a list of available namespaces: 1. ``` # Defines Kubernetes default namespace in which user's workspaces are created # if user does not override it. # It's possible to use <username> and <userid> placeholders (e.g.: che-workspace-<username>). # In that case, new namespace will be created for each user. # Is used by OpenShift infra as well to specify Project # # BETA It's not fully supported by infra. # Use che.infra.kubernetes.namespace to configure workspaces' namespace che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.default=<username>-che ``` 2. ``` # Defines if a user is able to specify Kubernetes namespace different from default. # It's NOT RECOMMENDED to configured true without OAuth configured. # Is used by OpenShift infra as well to allows users choose Project # # BETA It's not fully supported by infra. # Use che.infra.kubernetes.namespace to configure workspaces' namespace che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.allow_user_defined=false ``` Example of the implemented API response: ```json [ { ""name"": ""my-dev"", ""attributes"": { ""status"": ""Running"" }, { ""name"": ""java-ws-dedicated"", ""attributes"": { ""status"": ""Terminating"" }, { ""name"": ""sleshche-che-ws"", ""attributes"": { ""default"": ""true"" // Note that status is missing - means that such namespace does not exist on Cluster and will be created on the first workspace start } } ] ``` ### What can be improved later 1. User may not have permissions to create objects in some of the available namespaces. So, we could check if they have like deployment creation permissions before returning namespace. But it would require upgrading fabric8 k8s client(See K8s https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/commit/d1f2e77267924ace316a31917c6ecd0daf0a3738), it's why I would like to do it in a separate issue if needed. 2. On K8s infrastructure, OAuth is not implemented yet. Just allowing to choose any available namespace would mean allowing users to access any k8s namespace, even system like `kube-system`. @metlos propose to introduce a dedicate property to configure selector for available namespaces like `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.user_available_selector=app=che`. 3. In most OpenShift production cases - admin would need to precreate users' project and apply needed quotas there. So, the user would not be able to create new projects. But on some tests environments like minikube, minishift, crc a user is able to create new namespaces... So, it may be useful (may be not) to implement an ability to type free namespace name value and then Che would create this on the first workspace start. It may be implemented in two ways: checks automatically if a user is able to create a new namespace OR let che admin to configure such an ability with a dedicated configuration property. API could expose such an ability by returning a special namespace holder, like: ```json { ""name"": ""{new-namespace}"" } ``` ### Is this PR well-tested? Not yet. It will be tested and as proof will be here screenshots for different configurations and infrastructures. <details> <summary>Tested configurations</summary> #### Kubernetes: Single-User 1. Introduced parameters are default: `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.default=<username>-che` `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.allow_user_defined=false` Since in single-user mode there is only one `che` user, default namespace is `che-che`, which is not good but should not a big issue and may be handled by chectl - like override default namespace for single user to be the same as che namespace, it actully works in such way. So, che-che namespace does not exist: ```json [ { ""name"": ""che-che"", ""attributes"": { ""default"": ""true"" } } ] ``` 2. Introduced parameters are default: `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.default=che` `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.allow_user_defined=false` ```json [ { ""name"": ""che"", ""attributes"": { ""phase"": ""Active"", ""default"": ""true"" } } ] ``` 3. Introduced parameters are default: `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.default=NULL` `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.allow_user_defined=true` ```json [ { ""name"": ""che"", ""attributes"": { ""phase"": ""Active"" } }, { ""name"": ""default"", ""attributes"": { ""phase"": ""Active"" } }, { ""name"": ""kube-node-lease"", ""attributes"": { ""phase"": ""Active"" } }, { ""name"": ""kube-public"", ""attributes"": { ""phase"": ""Active"" } }, { ""name"": ""kube-system"", ""attributes"": { ""phase"": ""Active"" } } ] ``` #### OpenShift - Multiuser 1. OAuth is configured and introduced parameters are default: `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.default=<username>-che` `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.allow_user_defined=false` Logged in as developer, developer-che exists: ```json [ { ""name"": ""developer-che"", ""attributes"": { ""description"": ""A project to run Che Workspaces"", ""displayName"": ""Che Workspaces"", ""default"": ""true"", ""description"": ""A project to run Che Workspaces"" } } ] ``` 2. OAuth is configured and introduced parameters are: `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.default=<username>-che` `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.allow_user_defined=true` Logged in as developer, the user has developer-che and myproject projects: ```json [ { ""name"": ""developer-che"", ""attributes"": { ""phase"": ""Active"", ""description"": ""A project to run Che Workspaces"", ""default"": ""true"", ""displayName"": ""Che Workspaces"" } }, { ""name"": ""myproject"", ""attributes"": { ""phase"": ""Active"", ""description"": ""Initial developer project"", ""displayName"": ""My Project"" } } ] ``` 3. OAuth is configured and introduced parameters are: `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.default=<username>-che` `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.allow_user_defined=true` Logged in as developer, the user has myproject project only: ```json [ { ""name"": ""developer-che"", ""attributes"": { ""default"": ""true"" } }, { ""name"": ""myproject"", ""attributes"": { ""phase"": ""Active"", ""description"": ""Initial developer project"", ""displayName"": ""My Project"" } } ] ``` 4. OAuth is configured and introduced parameters are: `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.default=NULL` `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.allow_user_defined=true` Logged in as developer, the user has myproject project only: ```json [ { ""name"": ""myproject"", ""attributes"": { ""phase"": ""Active"", ""description"": ""Initial developer project"", ""displayName"": ""My Project"" } } ] ``` </details> ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? It resolves https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/14376 #### Release Notes N/A #### Docs PR N/A The workflow that user/admin would use is not complete yet, documentation will be provided in further PRs where workflow will be available.::Perhaps it's worthwhile to add what `<username>` and `<userid>` refer to (is it OpenShift user or Che user? What is a userid in this context?). ::Is this property nullable?::I would extract this branch of the `if` into it's own method (`getDefaultNamespace` or similar).::Can `tmpNamespaceName` be null? If it can't we should replace the `isNullOrEmpty` check with just `isEmpty`. If it can be null we could have an NPE here.::If `defaultNamespaceName` cannot be null, this check should be replaced with `isEmpty()`::This check could be combined with the one above (`if (oauthIdentityProvider == null || subject == Subject.ANONYMOUS)`)::Is there a reason to not use `Collectors.toList()` here?::Same as for `KubernetesNamespaceFactory`, consider extracting this branch to a separate method.::At this point it can not - empty value means - not defined. But it makes sense to add NULL as well. Will do.::It's always Che user but depending on configuration it may be the same as Keycloak, OpenShift, Github, Gitlab username... Will think more and maybe add some info but I would like to keep this description simple, without authentication-related stuff::I tried but failed to implement. Logic is different for two places where it's executed: 1. !allowUserDefinedNamespaces fetch default, create stub if does not exist, provision attributes 2. allowUserDefinedNamespaces try to find a default in fetched list, create stub if does not exist, provision attributes Will try again to refactor this place.::> If it can be null we could have an NPE here. In the scope of this method - we could. in the class - we can't because of checks in different places. Agree that it's not so clear and it makes sense to refactor it to make things clearer::now it can::Fixed copy/paste error. now debug messages are different. I would like to leave them separate checks.::I tried again but I don't like anything I got... I'm open to proposals.::The situation is a bit better since this method requires non-null `defaultNamespaceName` as argument. Feel free to reopen comment if you have more proposals on how to improve it.::Sounds good, I'm mostly concerned from an admin point of view, would be nice to have an idea of what `<user>-che` would look like. As an aside, can this cause issues if user creates an account that conflicts with a k8s-reserved namespace? E.g. with - `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.default=<username>` and username `default` - `che.infra.kubernetes.namespace.default=<username>-che` and username `kubernetes-anything` I don't know if this is worth documenting or if it would be considered common sense.::I mostly meant it as a way to break up the long method, e.g. ```java if (!allowUserDefinedNamespaces) { getDefaultNamespace(); } ``` and the same for OpenShiftProjectFactory, but if it's not clean it's not very important.::Makes sense to me, my confusion in the previous commit was due to null checking with `isNullOrEmpty`, which implies that the value could be null. The changes work for me.::will consider refactoring with two private methods like the following ``` public List<KubernetesNamespaceMeta> list() throws InfrastructureException { if (!allowUserDefinedNamespaces) { return singletonList(getDefaultNamespace); } // if user defined namespaces are allowed - fetch all available List<KubernetesNamespaceMeta> namespaces; try { namespaces = clientFactory .create() .namespaces() .list() .getItems() .stream() .map(this::asNamespaceMeta) .collect(Collectors.toList()); } catch (KubernetesClientException e) { // TODO Cover with test throw new InfrastructureException( ""Error occurred when tried to list all available namespaces. Cause: "" + e.getMessage(), e); } // propagate default namespace if it's configured if (!isNullOrEmpty(defaultNamespaceName)) { provisionDefaultNamespace(namespaces, defaultNamespaceName); } return namespaces; } ```::We're creating a copy of attributes in the constructor, yet we directly use the supplied instance here. What is the correct approach?::This is not a direct problem with this code, but we seem to be using `if (o != null && o.getClass() != getClass())` and the `instanceof` check interchangeably in various `*Impl`s. While almost the same, the semantics is slightly different (`getClass()` approach doesn't support subclassing nicely). What do we prefer?::I'm not against huge methods (being the author of many :) ) but if we basically have 2 independent impls of the method guarded by a boolean, I'd either go with 2 different methods implementing each branch or at least putting the 2 impls in an `if-else`. Right now, it looks like the part after the `if (!allowUserDefinedNamespaces) {...}` could be common for both codepaths when in fact it isn't. IMHO, nesting it in an `else` block would help reasoning about the code.::A bit of a nitpick but we're creating a hashmap with preinitialized capacity of (at least) 16 to put at most 1 element there.::The name of this test (`shouldReturnDefaultNamespaceOnlyWhenItDoesNotExistAndUserDefinedIsNotAllowed`) and the name of the previous test (`shouldReturnDefaultNamespaceOnlyWhenItExistsAndUserDefinedIsNotAllowed`) contradict themselves. What is the correct behavior?::This should be called `KubernetesNamespaceTest`, IMHO, because that's what it tests.::I'd, too, be really :smile: ::`Runtime Context`?::Makes sense, but is a little bit difficult to parse for me personally. What about: `Users are allowed to list projects but Che server is configured with a service account. All users will receive the same list of projects. Consider ...`::Again, the names of `shouldReturnDefaultProjectOnlyWhenItExistsAndUserDefinedIsNotAllowed` and `shouldReturnDefaultProjectOnlyWhenItDoesNotExistAndUserDefinedIsNotAllowed` seem to contradict each other.::Refactoring mistake. Let's blame IDE :-D Will fix.::It really! Believe me :smile: It reminds me the same story about `I am feel. I am very feel` https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUr_t_1uF64 :smiley: ::Good catch! The message if rewritten now `There is no runtime context for the specified workspace '%s'. It's the first workspace related call, so context is personalized with OAuth token.`::The wording is not my strong side ) Applied proposed variant::The difference it the following shouldReturnDefaultNamespaceOnlyWhen**ItExists** -> shouldReturnDefaultNamespaceOnlyWhen**ItDoesNotExist** Do you think it makes sense to rephrase the `ItDoesNotExist` one in the way like `shouldReturnDefaultNamespaceHolderOnlyWhenDefaultNamespaceDoesNotExist`?::Personally I prefer to go with way as we use in most places: Workspace and k8s API use instanceof of other impls Do you know some places where we use comparing `getClass()`? I'm OK with `getClass` as well, but it must be solved in general but not in one places if instanceOf lead to issues. I know that equals must be `Symmetric` and with instead of it's not BUT there was a big discussion previously and in the end we got nothing ) Are you OK with instanceOf in one more place? ::It's not documented. So, nobody knows ) But it's POJO style that we have in other places, like fundamental Workspace entity https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/caae00e21b2fd316560a406f2e1d8ad98edf1dad/wsmaster/che-core-api-workspace/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/api/workspace/server/model/impl/WorkspaceImpl.java#L269 It makes sense to contribute some contribution guide that would hold some info like that.::Since `DEFAULT_LOAD_FACTOR` is 0.75 - two `new HashMap<>(2);` should be enough. Are you OK with that?::Well, I find the names contradictory because `should return <a> only when <b>` and `should return <a> only when <!b>` just doesn't make sense - if `<a>` should be the right answer for both `<b>` and `<!b>` then there should be just 1 test called `should return <a>`, IMHO.::or alternatively, ""only when"" could be replaced with just ""when"" in both test names. ""Only when"" is XOR in my mind :smile: ::I guess it doesn't make much difference because we're  not using the map setters too much, but rather use `getX().put*()` and when we do use the map setter, we're disciplined about not leaking the map out of the context where the setter is used. It's just something that we need to keep an eye on.::only when replaced with when::`only when` replaced with `when`::it's refactored now::`che.properties` is not a place for user-oriented documentation.

Would not it be simpler if Che Server only know about such prefix and provide jwt-proxy ready to use `authPageUrl` with prefix included?::Well, the prefix is need for situations where there is an unauthed request which fails jwt verification. Then the flow is basically - go to the auth page and then go back to whereever the original request came from. There lies the problem, because we're still using a target-rewriting ingress - so by the time the request reaches the JWT proxy, we'll have lost the full path of the original request, because the ingress rewrote it. Which means that JWT proxy cannot correctly construct the ""whereever the original request came from"" URL.  The `authErrorRedirectUriPrefix` is basically a way of restoring that lost piece of the URL. Alternatively, I think it could work if we picked and chose carefully what ingresses where target-rewriting and what would not, but I didn't go down that route because I don't know the full consequence of that...::Looks confusing or I still misunderstand something. From naming I expect that jwtproxy will redirect to `authErrorRedirectUriPrefix` + `authErrorRedirectUri`, but what I got now: jwtProxy redirect to `authErrorRedirectUri + ""?redirectUri="" + authErrorRedirectUriPrefix`, is it correct? If yes - then maybe it would be better to name `authErrorRedirectUriPrefix` as `basePath` or something like that that would show the root path of jwtproxy application behind it.  ::The redirect URI is constructed on the JWT side upon receiving the original unauthed request like this: ```go protocol + ""://"" + req.Host + authErrorRedirectUriPrefix + req.URL.String() ``` where `req` is the original request. I wanted the name to highlight how this is actually used but `basePath` would work for me, too, even though not ideal either. It still doesn't give you an idea for why this is needed at all :) Let me think about a better name some more.::It would be useful to mention in PR description that cookies mechanism is a little patched: now path rules are changed from `{che-host}://theia-blahblah-432.192.168.99.100.nip.io` to `{che-host}://workspace123acsd/theia-blahblah-432.192.168.99.100.nip.io` and one cookie is used for all workspace servers::That is not exactly how it works. The cookie is required only for JWT-fronted endpoints. These endpoints were modified to deploy to `{che-host}/{workspace-id}/{jwtproxy-service-name}/{service-port}` (originally it deployed to `{che-host}/{jwtproxy-service-name}/{service-port}`). The auth cookie originally bound to the path `/` which means that it was valid for the whole domain it deployed to. This worked in multi-host mode because each service was its own domain, but fails miserably in single-host mode, because this essentially means we have a single auth cookie for all workspaces, which is not correct, because the auth mechanism works per-workspace. Now the auth cookie binds to `/{workspace-id}` which means that each `{che-host}/{workspace-id}` needs its own cookie - i.e. in the past we had a single auth cookie for the whole che server, and all workspaces running underneath, but now each workspace can have its own auth cookie.::Renamed to `public_base_path`.::Do you happen to know how K8s behalves if you try to create two ingresses with the same http path rule? I just wondering if using a common single cookies path won't lead to security issue... Like user creates a workspace, opens it, and as result has access token in a cookie that is configured with `/workspace123` path. The attacker knows workspace id, creates his own ingress with `/workspace123/show-me-your-token` path and service/pod behind just to read user token. Then it's pretty clear - attacker shares with the user a page which sends a request to `/workspace123/show-me-your-token` and steals a workspace access token As far as I understand, previously(multi-host + `/` as cookies path) it was not possible. If you set his own cookies path for each server, like `/workspace123/server-123` then it won't be possible as well (actually depending of k8s behavior when two ingresses with the same path exist) because `/workspace123/show-me-your-token` will not reuse already set access token in cookies, and `loader.js` will reject tries to steal token with error: `/workspace123/show-me-your-token` is not a part of `workspace123`. I may be wrong, it's just thought that came to my mind but please analyze if it makes sense. ::Should it be renamed here to `publicPathBase`?::are you going to use a fixed tag(sha based) or ```latest```?::Well, it was latest before and I could pull the image using latest, so I thought that we should keep that way. If you prefer the tag, I don't see a reason not to either. In fact, I'd prefer the tag, but didn't want to change the existing practice.::+1 to start using the particular tag instead of latest::yes. I prefer a tag (sha). Can you change it, please?::I worry that this is another default property that we will have to maintain. Are we going to have to issue a PR in Che for every PR in jwtproxy?::Well, IMHO that's better than breaking every existing che installation in case of the need of incompat changes in jwtproxy.::See the current catastrophe of failing E2E tests because we use theia:latest ;)::I agree, although down the line it would be great to be able to automate pinning versions on release in `che.properties` for all our various images.::I agree, but I think down the line we'll really need an automated way of setting these tags on releases.

Fixes possible workspace name collision when using factory with devfile. It takes `generateName` with precedence and converts `name` into `generateName`, when only `name` is defined. With this, we should always create uniquely named workspace that will have 5 random characters suffix. - When devfile has only `name`, it use it as generateName -> `nameYYYYY` - When devfile has only `generateName`, it uses that -> `generateNameYYYY` - When devfile has both `name` and `generateName`, it uses `generateName` -> `generateNameYYYY` (Y is random [0-9a-z] characted) I've choosen to take `generateName` over `name` here, because there is higher chance that it would generate nicer name.
