Wait until a condition is met rather than using time.sleep() with a hardcoded number of seconds. * Replace sleeping loops with support.sleeping_retry() which raises an exception on timeout. * Add wait_threads_blocked(nthread) which computes a sleep depending on the number of threads. Remove _wait() function. * test_set_and_clear(): use a way longer Event.wait() timeout. * BarrierTests.test_repr(): wait until the 2 threads are waiting for the barrier. Use a way longer timeout for Barrier.wait() timeout. * test_thread_leak() no longer needs to count len(threading.enumerate()): Bunch uses threading_helper.wait_threads_exit() internally which does it in wait_for_finished(). * Add BaseLockTests.wait_phase() which implements a timeout. test_reacquire() and test_recursion_count() use wait_phase().

During Python finalization, creating a new thread can now raise RuntimeError. Catch the exception and call terminate_broken() in this case. Add test_python_finalization_error() to test_concurrent_futures. concurrent.futures._ExecutorManagerThread changes: * terminate_broken() no longer calls shutdown_workers() since the call queue is no longer working anymore (read and write ends of the queue pipe are closed). * terminate_broken() now terminates child processes, not only wait until they complete. * _ExecutorManagerThread.terminate_broken() now holds shutdown_lock to prevent race conditons with ProcessPoolExecutor.submit(). multiprocessing.Queue changes: * Add _terminate_broken() method. * _start_thread() sets _thread to None on exception to prevent leaking ""dangling threads"" even if the thread was not started yet.

Wait until a condition is met rather than using time.sleep() with a hardcoded number of seconds. * Replace sleeping loops with support.sleeping_retry() which raises an exception on timeout. * Add wait_threads_blocked(nthread) which computes a sleep depending on the number of threads. Remove _wait() function. * test_set_and_clear(): use a way longer Event.wait() timeout. * BarrierTests.test_repr(): wait until the 2 threads are waiting for the barrier. Use a way longer timeout for Barrier.wait() timeout. * test_thread_leak() no longer needs to count len(threading.enumerate()): Bunch uses threading_helper.wait_threads_exit() internally which does it in wait_for_finished(). * Add BaseLockTests.wait_phase() which implements a timeout. test_reacquire() and test_recursion_count() use wait_phase().

Python cannot argue with kernel security changes towards blocking more attacks. The trend is to block more and more sensitive code patterns like memory pages which can be used for something other than just executing them. If you can READ + EXEC, ROP gadgets are easier to discover for example. ::I'm not saying the OS shouldn't be doing this. I'm asking if it makes sense to just ignore the error _on all posix platforms_, or rather whether the _test itself_ still makes sense if we're just going to ignore these errors from them.

The change got approved in the main branch. IMO it's ok to skip the test if mmap() fails with PermissionError. The Python test suite should not become a test of the operating system itself, but only of the small glue on top of the OS. If the OS decides that PROT_READ | PROT_EXEC raises a PermissionError, we can just skip the test.
